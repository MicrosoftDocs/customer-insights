# Signal Throttling Volume
Product Insights is a highly scalable application, capable of supporting millions of signals per second. During public preview, however, a project has a limit of 10 signals per second.

[Here](xref:developers/tutorials/product-preview-limitations) is the document detailing service specifications for Product Insights public preview.

If you have received an email notification indicating that your project has exceeded the limit and a volume increase would be necessary for your project, please forward the notification to [pirequest@microsoft.com](mailto:pirequest@microsoft.com).

Similarly, if you foresee that a volume increase would be necessary for your project, please send a request for volume increase to [pirequest@microsoft.com](mailto:pirequest@microsoft.com). We will be in contact with you to determine your project’s need for a volume increase and support your request.
