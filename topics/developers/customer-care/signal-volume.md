# Signal Throttling Volume
Product Insights is a highly scalable aplication, capable of supporting millions of signals per second. During public preview, however, a project has a safe limit of 10 signals per second.

[Here](xref:developers/tutorials/product-preview-limitations) is the document detailing service specifications for Product Insights public preview.

If you have received an email notification indicating that your project has exceeded the signal volume/ingestion limit, please forward the notification to pirequest@microsoft.com.

Similarly, if you foresee that a volume increase would be necessary for your project, please send a request for quota increase to pirequest@microsoft.com. We will be in contact with you to determine your project’s need for a quota increase and support your request.
