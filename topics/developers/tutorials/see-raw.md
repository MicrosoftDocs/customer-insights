# Use the Event Explorer to view raw data

You have downloaded the SDK and sent data. To verify this, you can use Event Explorer to view incoming events. 

To view your events, open the **Explorer** menu, and then select your project. You'll see a sample of your app's recent events, but it might take a few minutes for them to appear. Simply select the event you want to inspect.
You can also select **Event Explorer** from the **Applications** menu on the left.

Try selecting the event at the top, waiting for sample events, and clicking an event to see what type of data it contains.

The video below shows

To run more complex queries, try out our Kusto Explorer (link tbd). 
Kusto Explorer enables searching and queries over your raw Product Insights event data.
