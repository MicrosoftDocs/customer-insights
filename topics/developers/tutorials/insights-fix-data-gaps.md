# Fix data gaps

If you have a data set that is missing values, you can use the interpolation feature of Product Insights to fill them in.

## Example

1. Select an incomplete data set in which some points are missing or not connected.
2. Select **Fix** from the menu bar (see video below).
3. Product Insights will interpolate missing data points according to the current operation (such as **Average**) and complete your chart.
