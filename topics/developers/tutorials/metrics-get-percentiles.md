# Get percentiles 

Using percentiles, you can see more accurate views of extreme cases. For example, with average MPG you are unlikely to identify the best and worst cohorts. 

What are percentiles? If you have 100 cars reporting MPG values, you may be interested in the bottom 10 cars and top 10 cars. 99 percentile would tell you what the 99th car's MPG would be, if you lined them up in ascending order of MPG. 

To see percentile value, select 99th or 95th percentile operation, then the property such as CurrentMileage.
