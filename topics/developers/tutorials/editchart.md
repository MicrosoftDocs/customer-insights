# Create charts and dashboards

![Create charts and dashboards](Createchart.gif "Create charts and dashboards")

First, select the signal you want to view in chart form. Proceed to “slice and dice” your data by selecting **measure**, **filter(s)**, **Group by**, and transforming your data using **Smooth**. Measure your data's rate change using **Show change**. Check out other utilities to support your exploration under the **More** section.<br> 

Select **Line** and choose a different chart type from the drop down to see a different view of your data. Similarly, the time range and grain can be adjusted to your desired frequency.  

Our AI-powered engine provides hints or suggestions to help you view your data from additional dimensions and therewith, provide potential next steps for your consideration. 

Apply a suggestion by selecting it, and with the **undo** button at the top right of the chart, go back in time on your action. The **redo** button simply reapplies your settings.<br>
