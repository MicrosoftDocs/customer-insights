# Explore data

Product Insights makes it easy to see the data coming in from your products in real-time. You can see all your signals and their properties, and then drill down to a specific signal to see the data as it arrives in real-time. To further investigate the signal, click on **Explore**. Explore your data to slice, dice, and group the data to derive insights. Once you have the view you want, publish to a dashboard and share the insights with your team.
