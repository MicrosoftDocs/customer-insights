# Create a dashboard

Dashboards are a way for you to collect information about various signals and metrics that are important to your business, primarily in the form of multiple charts. Once you have created a dashboard, you can keep it private or share it with your colleagues or your whole company.

## Example

The following steps explain how to create a Project Insights dashboard. For further information, see the following video.

1. Select a project such as **Fabrikam Automobiles** from the projects list.
1. From the selected project, select **Dashboards** and then the **New dashboard** button.
1. The **New dashboard** window will appear. Enter the name of your new dashboard, such as _Test dashboard_, into the **Name** field, and optionally enter any text into the **Description** field.
1. Select the **Create** button. Your project's screen will appear.
1. Select your new dashboard's name from your project's screen. A screen will appear with the instructions, "Create the first chart." This screen is the first page of your new dashboard.
1. Select **Rename page** from the menu at the top of the screen. The **Rename page** window will appear.
1. Give your page a new name, such as _Main Charts_ and select the **Save** button.
1. Back on the first page of your dashboard, select the **New chart** button. A default chart for your project will appear. You can customize this later.
1. Select **New chart** again and an identical chart will appear on the same page.
1. Select **New page** and a second page will appear in your dashboard. You can rename this page in the same way you did the first one.
1. Select **New chart** again to add a chart to the second page.
