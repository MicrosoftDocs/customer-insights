## <a id="how_start"></a>Get started

To help you make the best of Product Insights fast, we organized the documentation site to be goal and task oriented. 

We expect you to watch all the videos in the **Get Started** section, which should take less than 5 minutes, 
before you start using Product Insights.

 
The **Do More** section teaches you all the possible ways you can achieve each of the tasks you learned in the "Get Started" section.
  
The remaining sections contain reference material that you can use as the need arises.
