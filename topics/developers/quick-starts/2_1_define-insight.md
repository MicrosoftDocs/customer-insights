# Define your insight

Create a count of cars divided into fuel types: a distinct count of VIN numbers, split into fuel types. Then select electric from the available fuel types. Add another split: cities.

Now you have a chart that shows cities with the highest number of electric cars. This seems like a useful value you can reuse in the future by turning it into a metric.
