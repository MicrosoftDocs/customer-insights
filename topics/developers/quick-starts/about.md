# Product Insights in a nutshell

Dynamics 365 **Product Insights** enables business users collect signals from their products and services and gain actionable insights into their customers’ usage and experiences. Powered by these signals and insights, businesses can transform not only their product development, sales, manufacturing, and customer care but also their business models and the types of experiences, products, and services that they can deliver.<br>

**Product Insights** transforms the product-related business processes from a traditional “sell-and-forget” model into fast, proactive processes powered by automated observational data from the product itself. Product development teams therefore use Product Insights to make data-driven decisions and grow their business.<br> 

**Product Insights** integrates seamlessly with Dynamics 365 **Customer Insights** as well as the rest of the Dynamics 365 suite so that customers can gain holistic and actionable insights into their customers, products, customer service, sales, and marketing.<br>
