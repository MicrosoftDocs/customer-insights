# Tweak metrics

Let's try a couple of tweaks. You may want to create another metric. For example, different cities have different patterns. You decide to compare MPG for the same model, same year, but in different city types. 

In cities where traffic is usually bad, MPG is lower even for exactly the same models. You decide to track this metric as well. Perhaps the sales team could look into whether city commuters are more interested in electric or hybrid vehicles. 

You can now add this new metric - 'MPG difference per city type'
