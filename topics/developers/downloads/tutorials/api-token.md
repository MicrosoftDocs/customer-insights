# Get an API token from the Product Insights portal

_With Product Insights, it’s easy to create a project with the Instrument Wizard and begin adding, checking, editing, and deleting its features with the Project Manager._

1. From the **Home** screen in the Portal, click **Explorer** in the navigation pane on the left. The **Projects List** appears.

2. Add a new project by clicking the plus sign at the bottom of the list. The **Instrument Wizard** appears, displaying the **Create a project** page.

3. Enter a name for your project.

4. Leave the default value of **Sandbox** for **Group**.

5. Select **Create project**. The **What platform are you using?** page appears.

6. Pick a platform from the drop-down list, but don’t click **Next**. Click **Skip this wizard** instead, and the **Project Manager** page appears.

7. Your API token appears on the right side of this page, under **Ingestion Key**. Leave this tab open in your web browser because you will come back to it and copy it to the clipboard for use later.
