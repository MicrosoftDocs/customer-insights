# Concepts and terminology

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This list defines selected terms that appear frequently in Product Insights and in its supporting documentation.

## Attribute

Metadata for a property of an object, element, or file.

## Derived signal

A virtual view of a base signal. These are generally used for scoping down a base signal for export, or for cleaning up a signal containing properties that aren't necessary for exposure or export.

## Environment

A space in which to store, manage, and share an organization's business data, apps, and flows.

## Event

A single occurance of data sent to Product Insights. If you think of a **signal** as a flowing stream of data, an event is that stream at a specific point in time. 

## Member

A member is assigned as a way of managing users’ project permissions. Currently, the only role available in Product Insights is “Owner”, which allows the user to manage the project and its data, and to view reports. 

## Metric

A quantifiable measurement of data, used to track or assess a process. Examples of relevant metrics in Product Insights include page views and average time spent on site.

## Project

A grouping of data and reports in Product Insights. New projects include preconfigured reports and insights based on the type of product you want to analyze.

## Report

A collection of data visualizations. Product Insights includes several predefined reports for web projects. 

## Signal

Data sent to Product Insights from an outside source, such as a website, mobile app, or IoT device. Signals provide a continuous flow of data that can be analyzed for real-time insights into how customers use and experience your product.
