# Run comparisons
[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To compare the current trends in your data with a past period or its historic trend on the same chart, use the configurable **Compare** feature.    

Comparing the number of items (such as calls) to a previous period is often the first transform to try. Select a comparison, then choose which period you will compare it to. You can select the number of days or weeks. The graph will update with another series from the time period of your choice.
