# First run experience

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article explains how to create a Dynamics 365 Product Insights instance and how to set up an environment.

## Sign up for Product Insights and create a project

1. In your browser, go to the [Dynamics 365 Product Insights](https://pi.dynamics.com/) website. Create a new account, or sign in with your existing credentials.
2. Once signed in, you'll see the **Get started with Product Insights!** dialog box. Select your current region, and use the checkbox to indicate whether you want to opt in to receive updates and offers via email.
3. Review the **Product Insights Preview Terms of Service** and **Privacy Statement**, then select **Next** to accept them.
4. Select the type of activity that you want your project to measure. Currently, **Website activity** is the only available choice. **App activity** and **Device activity** will become available in future releases. Select **Next** to confirm and create the project.
5. You'll see a success message, and a code snippet that must be added to your website to start receiving data in Product Insights. You can implement this right away, or **share the code** and instructions for implementing it with your webmaster via email. You can always find this code again later by going to **Admin** > **Data** > **Code** in Product Insights.
6. Select **Done** to go to your Product Insights instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Data will not show in Product Insights until the code has been implemented on your website.

## Add members to an existing project

By default, only the person who created the Product Insights instance will have access. You can add other users from your organization to an existing project at any time.

1. Go to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Members**.
2. Select **+ Add members**. Use the **Members** field to search for other people in your organization. You can add multiple members at once.
3. Select a **Role** to assign to the new members. Currently, **Owner** is the only available selection. Other roles will be added in future releases.
4. Select **Add** to confirm and return to the **Members** page.

To remove members from a project, select **...** next to their name on the **Members** page and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.

## Edit an existing project

You can edit the details of existing projects at any time.

1. Select **Admin** > **Settings** > **General** in the navigation menu.
1. Enter the new **Name** or **Description** for your project
1. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

## Add another new project

You can create additional projects to separate your data.

1. Select the organization name symbol in the bottom-left corner of Product Insights.
2. Select **+ New project**.
3. Enter a **Name** and an optional **Description**.
4. Select **Create**.

## Switch between projects

If you are a member of multiple projects, you can switch between them by selecting the organization name symbol in the bottom-left corner of Product Insights, and selecting your desired project from the list.
