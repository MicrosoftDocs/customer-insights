# Get started after purchasing Customer Insights

This article explains how to take your first steps in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights after your organization has purchased a subscription. If you'd like to purchase Customer Insights, our contact options are listed on the [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights website](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/). 

After purchasing a subscription license for Customer Insights, the global administrator of the Microsoft 365 tenant receives an email that invites them to create the environment. 

Customer Insights is licensed per tenant and includes multiple capabilities. You can purchase more capacity and licenses to increase the default quota.
