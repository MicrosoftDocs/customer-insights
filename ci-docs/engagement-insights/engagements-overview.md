# About Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Engagement insights capability enables organizations to understand interactively, how customers are using their services and products both individually and holistically – through websites, mobile apps and connected products. Engagement insights capability combines behavioral analytics with transactional, demographic, survey, and other data types from Customer Insights to create rich insights that help drive next best actions and personalized experiences. 

## Features and benefits

- Get started quickly: Collect, measure, and understand customer behavior on your website, in your mobile apps, and across your connected products.

- Out-of-box reports: Use reports to interactively access your site metrics and see the size of your audience. Find details about visits, page views, referral traffic, and identify pages with the best performance.

- Custom reports: Use the custom report builder to build your own visualizations. They can be based on metrics, dimensions, and segment combinations. Use these visualizations to curate the views you need to answer the business questions at hand.

- Multi-channel analytics: Bring in data from multiple channels. For example, behavioral data from website interactions together with transactional and demographic data about your customers. Use this data to build and view interactive reports that include web activities, customer profiles, and customer activities for rich analytics. Create and export refined events and view your web activities alongside customer profiles, activities, and segments in Customer Insights for a 360-degree view on your customers.
