This list defines selected terms that appear in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability and in its supporting documentation.

## Metric

A quantifiable measurement of data, used to track or assess a process. Page views and average time spent on site are examples of relevant metrics.

## Project

A grouping of data and reports in engagement insights capability. New projects include preconfigured reports and insights based on the type of product you want to analyze.

## Refined event
