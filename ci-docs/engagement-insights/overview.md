# About Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability 

[Engagement insights, a capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/engagement-insights-capability/) enables you to understand, using interactive metrics, how your customers are using your services and products. You can do this both individually and holistically, on websites, mobile apps, and connected products.

With engagement insights, you can combine behavioral analytics with transactional, demographic, survey, and other data types from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. This capability creates rich insights that help drive next best actions and personalized experiences.

## Features and benefits

- Collect, measure, and understand customer behavior on your website.

- Use out-of-box reports to  access site metrics interactively and reveal the true number of visitors to your website. Find out details about visits, page views, referral traffic, and identify pages with the best performance.

- Use the custom report builder to build your own visualizations based on selected [metrics](glossary.md) and [dimensions](glossary.md). These visualizations create the views you need to answer your business questions.

Use the data to build and view interactive reports that include web activities and customer profiles for rich analytics. Create and export refined events.
