[Engagement insights, a capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/engagement-insights-capability/) enables you to understand interactively, how your customers are using your services and products – both individually and holistically – on websites, mobile apps, and connected products.

You can combine behavioral analytics with transactional, demographic, survey, and other data types from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. The combination creates rich insights that help drive next best actions and personalized experiences.

## Features and benefits

- Collect, measure, and understand customer behavior on your website.

- Use out-of-box reports to  access site metrics interactively and see the size of your audience. Find out details about visits, page views, referral traffic, and identify pages with the best performance.

- Use the custom report builder to build your own visualizations based on selected [metrics](glossary.md) and [dimensions](glossary.md). The visualizations create the views you need to answer your business questions.

Use the data to build and view interactive reports that include web activities and customer profiles for rich analytics. Create and export refined events.
