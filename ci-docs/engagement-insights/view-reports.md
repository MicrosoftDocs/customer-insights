A report is a collection of data visualizations. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights comes with a set of out-of-the-box reports, using the data collected through the SDK. You can access them from the **Reports** page. The reports are grouped into four categories:

- **[Key metrics](#key-metrics-reports)**
- **[Content](#content-reports)**
- **[Traffic sources](#traffic-sources-reports)**
- **[Visitor profiles](#visitor-profiles-reports)**

- Select a time frame for a report by choosing a value from the **time/date range** drop-down list. The time range selection is disabled for a real-time usage report; the time range for a real-time usage report is “now.” 

- In most reports, select a value in a chart or list to filter the report for the selected value.
