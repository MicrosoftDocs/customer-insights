Privacy regulations and important evolutions around customer data control requires organizations to constantly adapt their marketing scenarios.

The consent management capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights enables organizations to manage how they use the data they gathered about their customers. The consent and preference management tool simplifies managing requirements by building a unified space of consent data from various outlets an organization uses to connect with their customers.
