# Use Microsoft Teams meetings v2 to create online meetings in Customer Insights - Journeys

The Teams meeting option allows you to create an interactive online meeting experience where all attendees can share audio, video, or content. More information about Teams meetings: [Meetings in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/overview-meetings-webinars-town-halls).

After selecting Teams meeting v2 as the streaming provider for your event, you see a new option called **Open settings**. This opens a Teams meeting options pop-up in a separate window and allows you to access all of the meeting-related controls directly in Teams.

After you save your event, your settings will be reflected in your Teams calendar item. As an organizer, you will receive an automated email directly from Teams. After creating the event, going live with it, you should [send the registrants an email](email-design.md) to provide the attendee URL. In the Customer Insights - Journeys email designer, you’ll find a **Join in Teams** option in the **Link to** menu for the button element. The **Join in Teams** button generates a unique attendee URL for each attendee.

> [!NOTE]
> Synchronization between Teams and Customer Insights - Journeys works in one direction: from Customer Insights - Journeys to Teams. The Teams calendar item for your event is read-only. Any changes you make in Teams may be overwritten by Customer Insights - Journeys. Make sure to manage and edit your meeting only from the Customer Insights - Journeys app.
