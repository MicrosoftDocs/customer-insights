# Record and publicize sponsorship details in outbound marketing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](user-guide.md), which will be removed from the product on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md)

*Sponsors* are people or organizations who contribute funds, equipment, or services in return for having their logos and messages placed in your event materials (including the event website) or at the event itself.

[Open the Events work area](open-events.md) and go to **Events** > **Sponsorship Management** > **Sponsorships** to view, edit, and create sponsorship records. Each record here must be associated with an event record, and the sponsoring company (account record) must also be stored in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys. Each record can also include information about the sponsorship deal itself, including the sponsorship type (money, services, or equipment), sponsorship value, and other details. If any sponsored articles are associated with this sponsorship, they are also listed here.

> [!TIP]
> The event website typically lists the sponsors of each event, where they are shown using a name and logo. For details about how to add logos to your event sponsors, see [Configure website graphics and registration options](set-up-event-portal.md#website-graphics-options).

You can also set up *Sponsorable articles*, which are items that are visibly present at the event, and feature a sponsor's logo or message. These typically include small freebies given away to event attendees, but could also be some type of infrastructure or facility provided to event-goers. Go to **Events** > **Sponsorship Management** > **Sponsorable articles** to view, edit, and create these records. Each sponsorable article record must relate to a parent sponsorship record (which identifies the sponsoring company and the event) and include price and quantity information.
