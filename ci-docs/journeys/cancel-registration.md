# Set up event registration cancellation

With Set up event registration cancellation, organizers can:

- **Add a cancellation link directly in registration confirmation emails**: Attendees can click the link to access a standalone cancellation page.
- **Enable self-service cancellation**: Event registration cancellation allows users to cancel their registration without needing to sign in or contact support.
- Manually cancel event registrations.

## Add a cancel registration button to event email

Organizers can also set up cancellation flow by adding cancel registration button to an event registration confirmation email. To add a cancel registration button to an event registration confirmation email:

1. Add a button element to the email.
1. Link to "Cancel event registration."
1. Define if you want the cancel registration linked to a specific event or automatically set for all events.

Once the attendee receives the email and clicks the cancel registration button, a standalone page opens. If this event registration is linked to sessions as well, a list of sessions the attendee signed up for is also listed. Attendees can cancel specific session registrations or the entire event registration. 

## Cancel registration manually 

If your attendee can no longer attend and lets you know via email or through phone, you can also manually cancel event registration by going to the **Registration and Attendees** tab. Here you can select relevant registrations and select "Cancel registration" on top of the grid.
