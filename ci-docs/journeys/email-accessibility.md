# Email accessibility checker

The accessibility checker helps you make the content easy for people of all abilities to read. With this feature, you can check the accessibility of emails created using the Customer Insights - Journeys content designer and receive guidance on suggested fixes.

Once you're done designing your email content, just select the **Accessibility checker** listed under **Email checker** in the **Designer** tab. The checker runs the content against Microsoft Accessibility Standards to find any issues.

The accessibility checker lists any issues it finds that don't conform with Microsoft Accessibility Standards.

You can drill down into any of the accessibility issues found to get help on how to fix the particular issue.

Once you make an update, you can hit the button at the end "Check it again" to ensure your fix passes the accessibility requirements.
