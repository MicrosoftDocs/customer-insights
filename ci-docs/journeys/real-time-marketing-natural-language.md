# Use natural language in journeys

Natural language input enables you to use common words and phrases to describe a condition you want to include in your customer journey. The data model is built on top of Common Data Model (CDM).

## Use natural language input

1. To create a condition using natural language, go to **Customer Insights - Journeys** > **Engagement** > **Journeys** and open an existing journey or create a new one.
1. Select the plus sign to add an element, then add an attribute branch to branch based on a specific value.
1. A side pane titled **Attribute** will open. Enter the following information in the side pane:
    - **Display name**: To identify your attribute branch, enter a name for it.
    - The manual input will appear by default. To use natural language input, select the lightbulb icon.
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Use natural language input.](media/real-time-marketing-nl-condition-input.png "Use natural language input")
    - Type your clauses using natural language the text box.

## Sample conditions

You can create a segment that will evaluate your Dynamics 365 organizational database for customers that meet a certain criterion. For example, customers with an annual income of $100,000.

The following are examples of simple conditional phrases using natural language:

**Search by company**

- Customers who work at Microsoft (Profile)
- People who work in a company named Contoso (Profile/Contact)

**Search by demographic**

-	Female customers (Profile)
-	Contacts in Seattle (Contacts)
-	Customers who are in Ohio (Contacts)
-	Contacts with vice president as job title (Contacts)
-	Customers with vice president as job title (Contacts/Profile)

**Search by segment membership within your organization** 

- Customers who are in Loyalty Segment

## Give us feedback

The natural language model is constantly learning. If you try a query that doesnâ€™t work, you are always welcome to provide feedback.

To provide feedback after you've entered a natural language clause:

1. A thumbs up/thumbs down icon will appear below the text box.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Natural language feedback.](media/real-time-marketing-nl-condition-feedback.png "Natural language feedback")

1. Select the **thumbs down** icon.
1. Select **Send feedback**.
1. Enter a short explanation of what happened. Add comments about what you would expect the phrase to look like.
