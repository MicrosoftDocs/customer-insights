# Journey templates

> [!NOTE]
> Due to rollout delays, journey templates aren't available until mid-March 2025.

Journey templates in real-time journeys make it easy for people across your organization with various skill levels to start a journey quickly and ensure it's setup with the right parameters, content, and logic. When starting a journey from a template, journey authors can swap out segments, emails, or other tile content to match the needs of the customer experience they want to deliver without having to build the whole logic tree.

## Creating journey templates

To create a journey template from the template library:

1. From the template library, select **New journey template** to open the journey editor where you can author the desired journey.
1. Select **Save**. 
1. Select **Save as template**.

To create a journey template from an existing journey in any state (including those journeys that have completed), choose **Save as template** to turn the existing journey into a template. 

To create a journey template from the journey editor:

1. Author your journey.
1. Select **Save** to enable the **Save as template** option.
1. 1. Select **Save as template**.

## Editing journey templates

> [!NOTE]
> To edit a journey template, you need to open one and save it as a new template. You cannot edit existing templates.

To edit a journey template from the journey editor:

1. Select **New journey**. 
1. Select the template you want to edit.
