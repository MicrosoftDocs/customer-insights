# Journey templates

> [!NOTE]
> Due to rollout delays, journey templates aren't available until mid-March 2025.

Journey templates in real-time journeys make it easy for people across your organization with various skill levels to start a journey quickly and ensure it's setup with the right parameters, content, and logic. When starting a journey from a template, journey authors can swap out segments, emails, or other tile content to match the needs of the customer experience they want to deliver without having to build the whole logic tree.

## Creating journey templates

To create a journey template, after saving a journey you've authored, choose **Save as template** next to the **Save** button. Provide a title and description to help others in your organization understand what kind of customer journey engagement the template is for and when to use it.

You can save journeys as templates with placeholder content selected or only with tiles in place and no content populated.

## Start a journey from a template

Anyone creating a journey can select your template from the list of available templates when creating a journey from scratch in the journey editor.
