# Tutorials for specific scenarios

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](user-guide.md), which will be removed from the product on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md)

The tutorials in this section are more general than the guides in the [Core marketing tutorials](basic-tutorials.md) section. The features covered here are all important parts of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, but they are more specialized so some may only be needed occasionally, and you don't need to do the tutorials in order.

When you have completed the exercises here, you'll be able to:

- [Set up automatic lead scoring](set-up-lead-scoring.md), which can score leads based on demographic information and interaction records.

- [Create a customer journey that generates activities](generate-activities-from-customer-journey.md) (such as phone calls, tasks, or appointments), assigns them to relevant staff, and associates each with a contact on that journey.

- [Manage images](manage-images.md) for use in marketing emails and pages.

- [Track website visits, social media clicks, and banner clicks](track-online-behavior.md) so you can use them to score leads and evaluate the effectiveness of your website and other marketing channels.

The exercises in this chapter assume you are already familiar with the functionality described in the [Basic tutorials](basic-tutorials.md) chapter, but they don't build on each other, so you can pick and choose the exercises that interest you most.
