# Transition Customer Voice responses

In Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, survey responses from Customer Insights - Journeys show as “Marketing respondent."

If you want to view a full list of who responded to your survey using Customer Insights - Journeys, follow these steps:

1. In your browser, open this link: `https://your-Customer-Insights-domain/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&etn=msfp_surveyresponse`. For example, `https://contoso.dynamics.com/main.aspx?pagetype=entitylist&etn=msfp_surveyresponse`.

    This opens a banner informing you that it’s recommended to open this in an application.
1. To open the list, choose a Customer Insights - Journeys app then bookmark the final URL for future reference. This opens a list of all survey submissions.
1. You can customize the view and add or remove relevant columns. In the upper right corner, select **Edit columns** and choose the columns that you need to display.
