# Publish an outbound maretking custom channel on AppSource

> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](../user-guide.md), which will be removed from the product on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](../transition-overview.md)

Once you have your custom code (plug-in or workflow), tile, and custom entities/forms tested and ready for the custom channel, you can publish it on [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) where users can download and install it in their Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys instance.

To do so, add all the components for the custom channel in a solution, and then publish it on Microsoft AppSource. For detailed information about publishing apps on AppSource, see [Publish your app on AppSource](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/publish-app-appsource).
