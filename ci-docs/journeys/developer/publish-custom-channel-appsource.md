# Publish an outbound marketing custom channel on Marketplace

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](.././includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](../user-guide.md), which is gradually being removed from Customer Insights - Journeys.** To avoid interruptions, stop using outbound marketing and transition to real-time journeys. Learn more: [Transition overview](../transition-overview.md).

Once you have your custom code (plug-in or workflow), tile, and custom entities/forms tested and ready for the custom channel, you can publish it on [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com) where users can download and install it in their Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys instance.

To do so, add all the components for the custom channel in a solution, and then publish it on Microsoft Marketplace. For detailed information about publishing apps on Marketplace, see [Publish your app on Marketplace](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/publish-app-appsource).
