# Build an outbound marketing approvals feature using Power Automate

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](.././includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](../user-guide.md), which will be removed from the product on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](../transition-overview.md)

By integrating your approvals feature with Power Automate, you can implement features such as these:

- Automatically generate and send request-for-approval emails to approvers.
- Include active approve and reject buttons in request-for-approval emails.
- Easy customization of the approval steps, using a framework that most administrators will be able to understand and adjust for themselves.

1. Select the **Solutions** tab from the left pane and then from the list of available solutions, select **Sample Approval**. 
1. Select **New** and then select **Flow**.
1. Enter the **Flow Name** in the upper left corner, select the **Triggers** tab, search for **When a record is updated**, and then select it.
