[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](.././includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](../user-guide.md), which will be removed from the product on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](../transition-overview.md)

This topic walks you through the process of hosting your custom event website on **Azure**. More information [Build and host custom event website](event-management-web-application.md).

## Prerequisites

1. Download the [source code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2042224) to customize the provided demo website.
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 10.x or higher.
3. Download the [Azure Storage Explorer](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows)

## Step 1:  Create an Azure storage account

To create an Azure storage account, follow the steps below:

1. Login into [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and click on **Sign in**, if you don't have an Azure account, register for it.

2. Click on **Storage accounts** and click on **Add** to create a new storage account.
  
    ![Storage accounts.](../media/storage-accounts.png "Storage accounts")

3. In the **Subscription and Resource group** dropdown, select your subscription from the existing list of subscriptions. When you select an existing **Subscription**, the **resource group** field displays the available resource groups. If you don't have an existing one, create a new **Resource group**.

4. Enter the **Storage account name** and also select the **Location**.

5. Set the values as shown in the screenshot and click on **Review + create**

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can modify all the settings that suit your needs.

6. Review your configuration and click on **Save**

### Enable static website hosting

1. Select the newly created **Storage account** and click on **Static website**

2. Enable the **Static website** by flipping the switch and name the **Index document name** and **Error document path** as `index.html` (must be lowercase)

    ![Static website.](../media/enabling-static-website.png "Static website")
3. Click on **Save**. A new field **Primary endpoint** is shown. Copy the URL from the **Primary endpoint** field. This is the URL from which you reach your custom event website.

## Step 2: Register your web application

To use event management public API, you need a web application token. The web application token is used to control API requests that are associated with your organization. More information: [Register your web application](register-web-application-events-api.md).

## Step 3: Create environment.ts file

1. Open the [source code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2042224) with your favorite IDE (we recommend Visual Studio Code).  
2. Navigate to `src/environments/` directory. 
3. Create an empty `environment.ts` file (if it doesn't exist).
4. Open the file `environment.selfhosted.ts`. This file contains all the configuration settings for your event website. 
5. Enter the **Endpoint** field value from the web application record that you have created in the `apiEndpoint` field. Append `EvtMgmt/api/v2.0/` to the `apiEndpoint` value. It should look like this `https://orguniqueid.crm.dynamics.com/EvtMgmt/api/v2.0/`
6. Make sure to set the `useAadB2C` value to false.
7. Enter the generated **Token** field value from the web application record in the `emApplicationtoken` field and save the file. 
8. Open a terminal in the root of your custom event website directory and run the command
    ```CLI 
     ng build --prod --output-hashing none --configuration self-hosted 
    ``` 
9. This builds the website. You can find the generated files in `dist\self-hosted` folder. 

## Step 4: Upload your custom event website

1. Open **Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer** 
2. Sign in with your Azure account. 
3. Select your **Storage account** 
4. Select the **$web blob container**

   ![Web blob container.](../media/web-blob-container.png "Web blob container")
   
5. Upload all the files that you have generated before located in `dist/self-hosted` folder into the `$web` blob container. 
6. To see the custom event website in run time, copy the **Origin** field value from the web application record in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys and open it in the browser.
