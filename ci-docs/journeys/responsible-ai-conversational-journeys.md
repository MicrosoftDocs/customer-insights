# Responsible AI FAQs for conversational journeys

These responsible AI FAQs describe the AI impact of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys's conversational journeys feature.

## What are conversational journeys?

Conversational journeys is a new channel in Customer Insights – Journeys based on an integration with Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature is available only for customers who have Contact Center. The feature allows you to make phone calls with your customers. These phone calls can be Copilot Studio agent-based, Contact Center human agent-based, or a combination of both.

## What can conversational journeys do?

Conversational journeys utilizes the Contact Center Proactive Engagement capability. Contact Center Proactive Engagement allows you to also use Copilot Studio AI agents. You can use conversational journeys to orchestrate phone calls with your contacts. You can either have human agents responsible for handling the calls or develop a Copilot Studio AI agent to interact with customers. These AI agents can handle customer questions, share information, and also transfer the call to a human agent. The outcomes of the conversation (whether it’s human-based, an AI agent, or both) are sent back to Customer Insights - Journeys to move your customer to the next step of their journey.

## What is the intended use of conversational journeys?

The conversational journeys feature is intended to offer a new channel to autonomously make phone calls with customers. You can use it to proactively reach out to your customers to support and inform.

## How was the conversational journeys feature evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Conversational journeys utilizes Copilot Studio agents. It doesn't offer any additional AI capabilities beyond what Copilot Studio agents offer.

## What are the limitations of conversational journeys? How can users minimize the impact of conversational journeys limitations when using the system?

Customer Insights – Journeys utilize conversational journeys as any other channel, meaning that you can send a voice call request to Contact Center and then branch on the outcomes of the call. To ensure that your contact continues in the journey branching as you designed, you must ensure that your human or AI agents return the phone call results accurately back to Customer Insights – Journeys.
