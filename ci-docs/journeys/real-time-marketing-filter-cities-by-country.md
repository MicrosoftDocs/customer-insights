# Filter cities by selected country in Customer Insights - Journeys forms

Filtering the list of cities based on the selected country is a powerful way to simplify form interactions and improve data accuracy. Instead of overwhelming users with long, irrelevant dropdowns, this approach ensures they only see city options that match their chosen countryâ€”making the form faster to complete and easier to understand. This is especially valuable in scenarios like lead routing, where selecting the correct location ensures submissions reach the right team. In this guide, you'll learn how to set up this filtering using lookup fields and relationships between data tables.
