# Use quiet times in your journey to prevent messages from being sent during unwanted hours

In a journey, you see the type of [quiet time setting](real-time-marketing-quiet-times.md) that applies. It specifies whether quiet times use the journey time zone or the audience time zone, and general or advanced parameters. You can also change or disable quiet times for specific messages if a message in a journey shouldn't use the regular quiet times settings.

The journey lists the number of messages held for quiet times.
