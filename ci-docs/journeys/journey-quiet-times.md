# Use quiet times in your journey to prevent messages from being sent during unwanted hours

Quiet times let you set specific times when messages aren't sent to customers, so you don't contact them when messages can be unwanted. You might not want to send messages at certain times because of regulations, business policies, or other factors. Typically, quiet times are set for overnight hours, weekends, or holidays. When quiet time settings are in place, the system holds messages until quiet times end.

You can override these settings in a journey on a per-message basis in the **Property** tab. You can see what quiet times are in effect and specify whether quiet times use the journey time zone or the audience time zone. You can also change or disable quiet times for specific messages if a message in a journey shouldn't use the regular quiet times settings. 

## Adjust journey quiet times settings

In a journey, you see the type of [quiet time setting](real-time-marketing-quiet-times.md) that applies. It specifies whether quiet times use the journey time zone or the audience time zone, and general or advanced parameters. You can also change or disable quiet times for specific messages if a message in a journey shouldn't use the regular quiet times settings.

The journey lists the number of messages held for quiet times.
