# (FNAME) overview

(FNAME) solution brings power of Customer Insights - Journeys and Contact Center along with AI agents built using Copilot Studio to deliver customer experiences that delight customers at scale while reducing costs and increasing customer satisfaction. For example, you can easily setup proactive outreach for scenarions such as cancelled flight or product recall, as well as automate transactional calls such as confirming/scheduling a delivery. Organizations benefit from reduced call volume and support costs, while customers get faster resolutions without having to chase down answers. 

A typical (FNAME) solution has three parts. 
- First part is customer journeys that tell the AI agent who to call, when to call, and how to process choices the customer makes during the call. This part is implemented in Customer Insights - Journeys. This is where you setup consent management and quiet time/days to ensure customers are contacted in accordance to their preferences and regulatory requirements.
- The second part is the AI agent, which can converse with customers using natural language. This part is implemented in Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- The final part brings it all together, in Contact Center, where setup of customer service agentâ€™s customer queues, phone numbers, etc. takes place. Other behaviors such as, transfering call to a human rep if customer asks (or the AI-agent is unable to handle customer requests) is also defined here.

This entire solution can be authored with no code (including the ability to design the AI agent using natural language), making it accessible to non-technical business users to define their customer experiences with ease. 

Here is a quick map to navigate learning pages that cover above aspects of this solution:
