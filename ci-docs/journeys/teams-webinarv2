# Use Microsoft Teams Webinar v2 to host online events in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys

Use Teams webinars to create online presentations. One or multiple presenters can share content, videos, and audio. Participants can view the content and optionally engage with the presenters. Audiences engage through reactions, posting in the chat, or answering poll questions. Attendees can’t share their own audio, video, or content.
Webinars are useful for conference keynotes or meetings where a few presenters are talking to a large audience. Webinars can support up to 1,000 attendees. Webinars are the only Teams event types that support registrations which means that only people who are registered for the event can attend.

> [!NOTE]
> To use Microsoft Teams as an online event provider, you must have a [Microsoft 365 license](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description) that allows you access to the Teams service. If you do not have the correct license, you will not see the Teams webinar, Teams meeting, or Teams live event options as a part of the **Streaming provider** list.

## Create a Teams Webinar v2

1. Create a new event 
1. Set the toggle **Do you want to stream this event** toggle to **Yes** and select "Teams Webinar v2" from the dropdown
1. Define the meeting options by clicking on **Open settings**
1. Save the event record. Please note, that by clicking on "Save" the Teams meeting will get created and you will become the owner of the Teams meeting. By changing the meeting type and saving again, the original meeting will get cancelled and a new URL will get generated.

> [!NOTE]
> To be able to use Teams webinar v2 in Customer Insights - Journeys, your tenant administrator will first need to complete the authentication set up. Learn more about [Teams authentication in CIJ](/journeys/teams-authentication.md).

### Webinar settings

The default webinar settings are configured to provide the best attendee and presenter experience. However, you can easily tweak these settings from your Customer Insights - Journeys event. To change the default settings, click on **Open settings** This reveals the webinar settings, which you can adjust on a per-event basis directly in the Teams meeting options UI.

#### Webinar roles

| Role name                    | What do they do?                                                                                   | How to create them? |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Event owner                  | The user who owns the event record in Customer Insights - Journeys. | Set the event owner using the **Assign** button on the event ribbon. |
| Teams meeting owner          | The user who created and *saved* the record after choosing the webinar option in Customer Insights - Journeys. Changing the owner of the event record in Customer Insights - Journeys doesn’t change the owner of the webinar in Teams. Any change to the event record in Customer Insights - Journeys will only reflect in Teams when done by the owner or when they select **Sync to Teams**. | Sign in as this user in Customer Insights - Journeys and create a new event with a webinar or meeting stream. |
| Presenter                    | In a Teams webinar, a presenter is a person who presents audio, video, or a screen to the live event, or moderates the Q&A. Presenters can only share audio, video, or a screen (desktop or window) in webinars produced in Teams.| If you want to invite another person to present to the webinar, add them to the event or session as a speaker. To add a speaker, create a speaker engagement at the event (or session) level. The speaker is added as a “presenter” for the webinar. Ensure that the speaker's email ID is filled in.

#### Invite a guest to present in a webinar

- Ensure that the guest user is added to your Teams instance. You only have to do this once. Learn more about adding guest users: [Guest to present](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/plan-for-teams-live-events#guest-to-present).
- As a best practice, Teams recommends that you create a channel for producers and presenters so they can chat and share information before the event. Guests who don't have Microsoft 365 credentials won't see the calendar in Teams. To make it easy for guests to join the event, producers can post the event link to the channel. Presenters can then open Teams, go to the channel, and select the link to join the webinar.
- Add a guest as a presenter in your webinar by adding them as a speaker in your event or session in Customer Insights - Journeys using the steps detailed in the table above.

### View webinar engagement data

After you run a Teams webinar-based Customer Insights - Journeys event, you can view the attendee engagement data (check-in and check-out times) in the Customer Insights - Journeys app.

To generate the engagement data, send an email invite to webinar registrants before the event that contains the webinar **Join in Teams** link. See [Inviting registrants to attend the Teams event through email](teams-webinar.md#inviting-registrants-to-attend-the-teams-event-through-email) for details about creating an invite email in the Customer Insights - Journeys email designer.

10 minutes after the webinar ends (based on the end date configured in the Customer Insights - Journeys app), the Customer Insights - Journeys app will automatically populate the engagement data for attendees.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Organizations that manage their Teams user policies need to make sure that the admin enables the **allowTrackingInReport** and **allowEngagementReport** policies before synchronizing the engagement data. For more information, see [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy).
