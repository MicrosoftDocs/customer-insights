# Create an event from another event in outbound marketing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](user-guide.md), which will be removed from the product on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md)

You can copy your existing event by using the **Save as** command on the toolbar.

This operation will copy most of the entities from your existing event to a new one. The copied entities include:

- Pass
- Session
- Session Track
- Speaker Engagement
- Sponsorship
- Event Custom Registration Field
- Business Process Flow
- Team Members
- Session Tracks

> [!NOTE]
> Registrations are excluded from the copy operation to prevent potential issues that could arise in the capacity management and ticketing of new events. Child events of a recurrent event are also not copied to the new event. Learn more: [Known issues and workarounds](known-issues.md#event-management).
