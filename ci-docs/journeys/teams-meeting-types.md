This article explains how to use Microsoft Teams as an online meeting provider for Customer Insights - Journeys events. Teams event functionality is incorporated directly into the Customer Insights - Journeys app, allowing you to use Teams meeting, webinars, Teams live events and Teams Town Hall for one/some to many online events.

For general information about setting up Microsoft Teams, refer to the [Microsoft Teams deployment overview](/microsoftteams/deploy-overview).

> [!NOTE]
> To use Microsoft Teams as an online event provider, you must have a [Microsoft 365 license](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description) that allows you access to the Teams service. If you do not have the correct license, you will not see the Teams webinar, Teams meeting, or Teams live event options as a part of the **Streaming provider** list.

## Create an online event

To create a Teams event, select **Event planning** in the Customer Insights - Journeys app area switcher, then select **Events** in the left navigation pane. Select **+New** in the top ribbon.

## Event streaming options

After you flip the **Do you want to stream this event** toggle to **Yes**, you’ll have six streaming options - Teams meeting, Teams webinar, Teams live event and then modernized set of options - Teams meeting v2, Teams webinar v2 and Teams Town Hall. This article will aim to help you understand the difference between all event types. 

### Teams meeting, Teams webinar, Teams Live Event 
This set of online event options represents the legacy Teams experience. While still available for use, these options are gradually being phased out in favor of modernized integrations and new event types. The updated meeting formats provide enhanced organizer controls and greater flexibility, so we encourage transitioning to these newer options as the older ones will be retired over time.

1. Teams meeting - allows you to create an interactive online meeting experience where all attendees can share audio, video, or content. More information about Teams meetings: [Meetings in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/tutorial-meetings-in-teams).
1. Teams webinar - useful for conference keynotes or meetings where a few presenters are talking to a large audience. Webinars can support up to 1,000 attendees and support attendee registrations. More information about Teams webinars: [Webinars in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/plan-webinars)
1. Teams live event - an extension of Teams meetings that enable you to schedule and produce events that stream to large online audiences. Teams live events are being replaced with Teams Town Hall and Teams will soon announce official removal date, please use Town Hall instead. More information about Teams live event: [Live Events in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-microsoft-teams-live-events-d077fec2-a058-483e-9ab5-1494afda578a)

### Teams meeting v2, Teams webinar v2, Teams Town Hall
The new generation of meeting types delivers the latest Microsoft Teams enhancements and features, powered by Graph API integration. These updates provide improved control over meeting options, enabling organizers to configure Teams settings directly within the Customer Insights – Journeys interface for a seamless experience.
