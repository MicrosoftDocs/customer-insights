# Analytics configurations in outbound marketing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](user-guide.md), which is gradually being removed from Customer Insights - Journeys.** To avoid interruptions, stop using outbound marketing and transition to real-time journeys. Learn more: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md).

Use these settings to connect your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys instance to Azure Blob Storage. This will enable you to share interaction data with external systems such as Power BI. For more information about how to use these settings, see [Create custom analytics with Power BI](custom-analytics.md).
