# Open the event management work area

The event management features of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys are collected into their own work area to make it easy to find all the relevant entities and settings while you are focusing on events.

To find the event management work area:

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to Dynamics 365 as a user with [event management privileges](admin-users-licenses-roles.md). Then use the app-selector menu to open the **Customer Insights - Journeys** app.

1. Expand the work area menu at the bottom of the side navigator and select **Event planning**.

1. You are now in the events work area and can navigate between event-related entities using the side navigator, just as with the core **Customer Insights - Journeys** work area.

1. You can create a new event by selecting **+ New Real-time event** or **+ New Outbound event** in the top navigation ribbon. When outbound marketing and real-time journeys are installed, youâ€™ll see outbound marketing and real-time journeys events in the same events list.
