# What's new archive for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys

This article contains archived information about new features, improvements, and bug fixes from previous years. This article is not maintained and is saved for historical reference purposes.

## 2024 updates

### December 2024 update

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Insights - Journeys        | 1.1.51539.118   |

#### General availability

- **Boost participation, simplify planning with session-based registrations** 
    - Event attendees can register for specific sessions in a multi-session event to ensure their event experience is relevant to their interests. With session registration data, you’ll be able to identify which sessions have the highest demand and tailor post-event follow-ups based on session participation.

    - [Docs](real-time-journeys-event-session.md)  

- **Easily deliver a common experience to multiple audiences with a single journey** 
    - Reuse existing segments to deliver a common experience in a single journey – no need to create a new segment for the combined audience. If you already have segments for different purposes, you can easily create many different audiences by using one or more of them in a journey. There's no need to create another segment from scratch, combine existing segments into a composite segment, or make multiple copies of the same journeys. Specifying multiple segments is not only straightforward and efficient but also enables you to create different audiences quickly (no need to get the segment creation role or wait on other team members to create a segment for you). Additionally, it reduces the number of segments that need maintenance or cleanup later and doesn't add to the overall segment limit.
    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-segment-based-journey.md#set-the-journey-start)  

#### Public preview

- **Understand customer inflows and exits at every journey step** 
    - It’s critical to understand exactly what happened to each customer who entered and exited your real-time journeys. With improved journey analytics, you’ll gain confidence in the processing of every step in your journey through improved metrics and an increased ability to export data. For example, if your journey uses exit or exclusion segments, you'll be able to see and understand why fewer customers started your journey than were in the entry segment. You'll also be able to see the list of customers who entered and exited each step in the journey and export lists of up to 50,000 people for further analysis.

- **Personalize messages and make journey decisions based on web interactions** 
    - With Customer Insights - Journeys, you can now track and leverage your customers’ online behavior to deliver personalized experiences across your digital channels. For example, you can boost conversions and customer loyalty by sending tailored offers after customers visit your website and show interest in a product or service. By tracking additional data about customers' online journeys, you can get valuable insights into your customers' preferences and needs and easily measure your campaign’s effectiveness.

- **Generate leads that link to an existing contact** 
    - Your business has unique ways of organizing customer data and classifying potential leads. Now with real-time journey forms, you can manage your contacts and leads more effectively, according to your company's established processes. For example, you can recognize existing customers who fill out a lead form, so they're not mistaken for new leads.With this new set of capabilities to connect lead and contact data, you can choose how existing contact or lead details should be updated and define advanced matching rules to prevent duplicate records. Additionally, you can set defaults so everything is already configured each time a new form is created. All these new capabilities allow you to fine-tune how form data is handled to provide better quality leads and match your company's established processes.

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Protect your forms with reCAPTCHA**
    - Protecting your forms against bot attacks and malicious actors is crucial to ensure the quality of captured data. You can now leverage the new Customer Insights - Journeys reCAPTCHA plugin and simplified setup to integrate reCAPTCHA into your forms.
    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-form-custom-captcha.md)

- **Form with new layout structure improving accessibility and responsiveness**
    - All newly created Customer Insights - Journeys forms have a new layout structure which no longer relies on the tables. This feature comes disabled by default. You can enable it in the feature switches.

- **Streamline segment management with the ability to stop live segments**
    - Marketers can now stop segments that are in a live state, eliminating the need for cumbersome workarounds like deleting the segment—risking loss of segment definitions—or leaving it in a draft state, which creates confusion about its usability. This capability enhances segment management by allowing marketers and admins to clearly distinguish between segments actively in use and those paused for adjustments. It reduces the risk of errors, such as using incorrect segments in journeys, and provides greater transparency and control over the segment catalog. By simplifying segment status management, this feature supports cleaner workflows, better organization, and more confident decision-making in audience targeting.

### November 2024 update

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Insights - Journeys        |  1.1.50062.76  |

#### General availability

- **Split audience into groups to deliver unique customer experiences** 
    - When you want customers to have different experiences in one journey, you need to divide them into groups. While this is possible today using attribute branches or segments, sometimes the number of customers in each branch is more important than what those customers have in common. For example, you may want to send a survey out to a random subset of your customers for feedback, something that would be time-consuming to configure today. The new journey split tile allows you to split your audience into branches to provide a subset of your audience with unique experiences, whether that be a survey, a new type of experience to test, or a first-come promotional offer. You can split your audience by percentages (for cases where you need randomness) or by numbers (for cases where you want to deliver specific experiences to a set number of people).

- **Improve engagement and compliance with double opt-in**
    - By implementing double opt-in, you can cultivate a more effective email marketing strategy, leading to improved compliance, increased open and click-through rates, and a better overall brand experience for subscribers. Privacy and data protection laws in many regions require double opt-in functionality to help verify customer information. Double opt-in requires users to confirm subscription preferences through a follow-up email after the initial subscription. By confirming subscription preferences a second time, you comply with legal requirements and improve engagement by ensuring that users who’ve subscribed are intent on receiving future communications. When customers are certain they want to receive email communications, spam complaints and bounce rates are reduced, and your sender reputation is improved. You can now configure if the double opt-in email is sent with each form submission or just once for the newly registered customers.

    :::image type="content" source="media/double-opt-in-nov.png" alt-text="An overview of double opt-in within Customer Insights - Journeys." lightbox="media/double-opt-in-nov.png":::

- **Export segment membership data for offline analysis** 
    - Marketers often need deeper insights and offline access to customer segment data. With this latest enhancement, you can now export segment membership data directly to Excel, supporting up to 100,000 rows per segment. This new capability makes it easier to analyze customer data in your preferred tools without the need for complex integrations or manual data handling. Previously, extracting large sets of data from segments required cumbersome workarounds. Now, you can seamlessly export detailed segment data for offline analysis and verification, enhancing your ability to make data-driven decisions. The export feature is available for segments with up to 100,000 members and includes a predefined set of columns: Contact/Lead ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number. This streamlined export ensures consistency and accuracy in your data analysis while maintaining simplicity. Custom columns or attributes aren't supported at this time.

     :::image type="content" source="media/export-segment-membership.png" alt-text="An overview exporting segment membership data for offline analysis within Customer Insights - Journeys." lightbox="media/export-segment-membership.png":::

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Flexible enforcement model for text and custom channels**
    - The enforcement model could be selected only for the email channel. With the latest update, you can select restrictive or non-restrictive enforcement model for text (SMS) and custom channels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on October 10, 2024, changes to link functionality affect the following areas:
> - **Link tracking**: Links in messages that were sent more than six months prior no longer produce tracking results, but otherwise function correctly. Links in messages sent less than six months prior continue to generate tracking analytics.

- **Get insights on email engagement with heatmap analytics**
    - Understanding the effectiveness of email campaigns can often be complex, particularly when information and links are abundant. Gaining clarity on which areas or links captivate your audience and drive them to act is crucial for refining the user experience and boosting email performance. Real-time journeys email insights now offer a clear view of your audience's preferences by illustrating their interactions within your emails. This immediate visual feedback highlights the content that resonates the most, empowering you to adjust your messaging for heightened impact and better conversion rates.

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Easily engage multiple audiences in a single journey with multiple segments**
    - If you already have created specific segments for different purposes and need to reach some or all of them, you can now easily do so by specifying multiple segments for a journey. There's no need to create another segment from scratch, combine existing segments into a composite one, or make multiple copies of the same journeys. Specifying multiple segments is not only straightforward and efficient but also enables marketers without segment creation roles to engage multiple audiences without waiting for a new segment to be created. Additionally, it reduces the number of segments that need maintenance or cleanup and does not add to the overall segment limit. 
        > [!NOTE]
        > All segments should be of the same entity, either leads or contacts or profiles. You can already specify multiple segments as exit segments or exclusion segments. This enhancement extends the ability to specify multiple segments to start a journey. Outbound marketing segments can't be used when specifying multiple segments.

### September 2024 update

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Insights - Journeys        |   1.1.48225.52   |

- **Refine email content in running journeys**
    - To maximize customer engagement, it's crucial for customer experience teams to regularly refine email content, ensuring that communication remains current, relevant, and impactful. You can now easily edit content, layout, links, buttons, or dynamic content in your email messages while a journey is running—without creating a new version or interrupting the customer experience. Changing email messages in live journey gives you more freedom and power over your email marketing campaigns and helps you to respond to changing business or customer needs.

- **Streamline form filling and event registration with form prefill**
    - The repetitive task of filling out forms can be a significant deterrent to event registration. Nobody likes to repeat information that they've already provided. Imagine loyal customers who attend multiple conferences each year having to input their contact information and preferences every time. Form prefill in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights eliminates the need to repeatedly request basic details from your customers, reducing redundancy and saving time. This not only expedites the registration process but also allows for more strategic collection of customer data over time.

    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-form-prefill.md)

- **Control how fast customers can enter a journey**
    - There are times when you want to reach a large audience, but sending a message to the entire audience at the same time would cause problems for your business. With journey rate limiting, you’ll be able to space out message sending over time by setting how quickly you want customers to enter your journey. This feature helps prevent overwhelming downstream operations with a large influx of requests from customers who receive messages from your journey. For example, let's say you have a journey that sends messages to your entire customer base with a call to action to contact your call center. You may want to avoid creating a poor customer experience due to long wait times from an overwhelmed help desk if you send messages at the same time to everyone. Instead, you can now slow down how fast customers enter the journey, avoiding thousands of phone calls at the same time.

    - [Docs](control-how-fast-enter-journey.md)

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Queued messages are not sent when journey is stopped**
    - When a journey is stopped, you now see an immediate change in the journey state to “Stopping.” This assures that your request was received and is being processed. Furthermore, if your messages are still pending in the send queue (this can happen when there is high volume of messages), such messages will now be removed immediately and will not be sent. This avoids a situation where messages continue to be delivered even though the journey has been stopped.
    - [Docs](journeys-overview.md)

- **Maximize email engagement and optimize content with link insights**
    - Link insights in real-time journeys allow you to analyze the performance of individual links in your emails. You can now view key metrics such as click rate and unique clicks per link and easily compare the performance of each link within your email campaigns. Use this data to optimize your content, improve engagement, and make more informed decisions to drive better results.
    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-analytics.md)

<!---

- **Outbound marketing removal notification and ability to hide outbound**
    - In-product banners are now shown to all users to inform them that Outbound marketing will be removed as of June 30th, 2025 and that social posting and LinkedIn lead generation will be removed as of Dec 2nd, 2024. We also added a highly visible card in the Settings > Versions page that talks about moving to real-time and now provide a button that can be used to hide outbound from the site map once the transition is complete.

#### General availability

- **Ensure messages go to the right contact email address**
    - It's critical that your messages are delivered by the right channel at the right time. Often, you'll need to pick the correct email address among the several you may have for a contact. Now you can choose which of a contact’s email addresses to target in your journeys. For example, some email messages may be more appropriate for a contact’s work email address, whereas others may best target a personal email address. Now, you have full control over which email address to send email messages to, enabling you to reach your customers where they’re most likely to see your messages and take action.

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Real-time journey segment membership**
    - Fixed an issue that causes inflated segment membership for some segments that use three or more entities and have repeating data in the columns.
This fix makes the membership data for those segments accurate, thus showing a lower count than before.
- **Real-time journeys now respect daylight savings time**
    - Recurring journeys that are scheduled to run repeatedly at a future date and time now adjust their schedules so that they are run at the expected time. For example, if you have a daily journey that runs at 9:00 AM in the Pacific Time Zone, that journey will continue to run at 9:00 AM after the next daylight savings time change. Before this fix, the journey would have run at 8:00 AM (or 10:00 AM), depending on the direction of the daylight savings time change.

You can still use the specific event option, if needed. (Note: this enhancement is available only in real-time journeys. Outbound marketing is still limited to using specific event selected at the design time and hence requires a separate email for each event). Learn more: [Use QR codes for event registration, links to content, or URLs](email-QR-code.md)
- **Quiet times: Change or disable quiet times for a specific message**
    - Change or disable quiet times enforcement on a particular message within a journey to support scenarios when a particular message in a journey should not be subject to regular quiet times settings.

## 2023 updates

### December 2023 update

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Insights - Journeys        |   1.1.35296.75    |

On September 1, 2023, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys transitioned to focus on real-time marketing features only. To support this transition, in early August 2023, provisioning of new instances changed in the following ways:

- New customers no longer receive the outbound marketing module. New customers need to contact support to add outbound marketing features.
- Existing customers see the same provisioning change but can add outbound marketing features themselves using a self-serve interface available on the **Settings** > **Versions page**.

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![New dynamics 365 customer insights org](media/real-time-marketing-transition-graphic.png "New dynamics 365 customer insights org")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> New requirements from [Google](https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection) and [Yahoo](https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/730172167494483968/more-secure-less-spam) for bulk email senders will go into effect in February 2024 that require emails to support one-click unsubscribe. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights will support this requirement for outbound and real-time journeys. To make use of one-click unsubscribe, you'll need to upgrade to the December 2023 release. A feature switch will become available to enable one-click unsubscribe in January 2024. Communication to administrators in the admin center will be sent once this feature is available.

You can control quiet times separately for different channels and message types as well as create unique settings for each line of business.

- **Enhance email engagement by allowing browser viewing**

You can also use the link to preview your emails and share them with your team for feedback and approval.

This allows you to use the Customer Insights – Journeys app for even more scenarios without having to use Customer Insights – Data app to create unified profile-based segments.

#### Monthly enhancements

**Journeys**
- Allow editing of default journey time zone in real-time journeys-only organizations
    - Organizations that only use real-time journeys can now edit the default time zone used when creating journeys. The default time zone can either be a single time zone across the organization for consistency or it can be set to use the time zone of the user who creates the journey for convenience. To set the default journey time zone, go to **Settings** and open **Journey Settings** in the **Customer engagement** section.
- Enable orchestration of email interaction triggers (email bounced, link clicked, and email blocked)
- Marketers can get a visual preview of the journey generated by Copilot so that they can decide if they are happy with the output

**Email**
- Search through data in email delivery and interaction details
    - In real time journeys, you can now effortlessly search through data in email delivery and interaction details. Search by email enables you to quickly pinpoint specific information within your analytics, making it easier than ever to find the insights that matter most.

**Personalization**
- Communicate clearly and concisely with conditional lists (#if within #each), advanced scope
    - Conditional lists can now be created using conditions on multi-select pick list (for example, pick a specific building our of many)
- Build conditions using data that is related via 1-to-many and many-to-many relationships
    - Conditions now support using data that is reached via 1-to-many or many-to-many relationship. For example, check if billed service units (an attribute of "Case") exceed a threshold for a contact’s most recent case. Previously, such a condition could not be defined because a contact can have multiple cases.

**Admin settings**
- Check the Customer Insights Journeys version and update
    - In the installation management experience, you can now check the version installed for the Customer Insights - Journeys application and update it if a newer version is available.
- Easily enable or disable all AI copilot features using a global opt-in toggle
    - All copilot features can now be enabled at once using one, global toggle, which is turned on by default.
- Non-US users can agree or disagree for cross-geography data flow to use AI copilot features
    - As Azure AI services are currently available only in North America (and Switzerland), all non-US users need to agree allow cross-geography data flow to use Copilot features.

**Security roles**
- Use compliance profiles from any business units in messages and forms
    - The default security roles for business units users have been updated to give permission to all users across the organization to use any compliance profile in real-time journeys emails and forms. If you use these security roles directly, you may want to consider if your users should have this expanded security. If you've created your own user roles, you may want to consider making these changes to enable full access to compliance profiles across business units. Specifically, we've changed the “Marketing Professional (BU Level) - Business” and “Marketing Manager (BU Level) - Business” security roles to have organization level **Read**, **Append**, and **Append To** privileges on the **Compliance Profile, Purpose, Topic** and **Preference Center** tables.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Insights - Journeys        |   1.1.30993.107     |

On September 1, 2023, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys transitioned to focus on real-time marketing features only. To support this transition, in early August 2023, provisioning of new instances changed in the following ways:

- New customers no longer receive the outbound marketing module. New customers need to contact support to add outbound marketing features.
- Existing customers see the same provisioning change but can add outbound marketing features themselves using a self-serve interface available on the **Settings** > **Versions page**.

#### General availability

- **Simplify and summarize segments using query assist Copilot functionality**
    - Updated Copilot-enhanced query assist streamlines your workflow and enables effective teamwork. Use query assist Copilot functionality in real-time marketing to create segments by describing them in plain English. Then, ensure your segment logic matches the intended outcome by translating the logic into a natural language description of the segment. Users who view or consume segments created by others can use the Copilot functionality to identify which audience the segment captures without needing to understand the segment creation logic. Query assist also offers suggested improvements during segment creation to help eliminate redundant conditional statements and further improve segment comprehension and performance.

    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-natural-language-segments.md)

- **Communicate effectively with personalized lists**
    - Lists are a common way to organize and communicate a repeated set of information such as a list of speakers or sessions for an event, list of items in an order, etc. Since lists can be quite information packed, ensuring only the relevant information is included is important (including what to include when a list item is missing some information). One way to personalize a list is to only include certain rows (for example, rather than listing all sessions of an event, only include online sessions). Another way is to annotate items that meet certain conditions, for example, indicate which sessions require additional registration or fee. Finally, there are times when you need to include additional information that is not in the data source of the list but in a related table. Now it's easier than ever to achieve such highly personalized and informative lists with enhanced capabilities to specify conditions at the list item level, include relevant information in related tables, control date/time format, and specify default values when a list item is empty.

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Analytics: Optimize email marketing efforts with enhanced email insights**
    - With the introduction of key performance indicators such as email Open Rate, Click Rate, and Delivery Rate in email insights, you can get a deeper understanding of your email campaign effectiveness. Moreover, in delivery and interaction details, you can now export up to 50,000 records of interaction data, as well as view the people that interacted with your email messages.
- **Journeys: Make updates to your journey by describing them in conversational language with journey Copilot**
    - In this release, we’ve made it easier for marketers to make small changes to their journeys by describing them in their own words. For example, you want first create a journey that sends emails to your loyalty members about an upcoming sale, then later want to address a more specific audience like customers who have a birthday this month. You can make this change by simply asking Copilot to switch out the audience.
- **Journeys: Create leads and opportunities from journeys**
    - For businesses that use leads and opportunities to track sales activity, they are a crucial output of the marketing process. Now you can create leads and opportunities directly within customer journeys, giving you the control to create the right leads and opportunities at the right point in your customer’s experience.
- **Personalization: Performance improvements for journeys using audience entities with many custom attributes**
    - The personalization layer now loads only the needed set of columns (instead of the entire entity) for audience entities (contact, lead, or profile) during journey execution. This reduces execution time significantly (and drives much higher journey throughput) for customers who have added a large number of custom attributes to their audience entities.
- **Email: Subject line and preview text limit is increased from 500 characters to 4000 characters**
- **Consent: Create segments from consent topics and purposes**
    - Use the consent captured from your customers to create segments that target people who have opted into receiving specific types of communications. Segments now support creating segments from topic and purpose contact point consent records, so that you can get accurate segment sizes and don’t include people who would not receive your messages. For example, create a segment that only includes contacts that have opted in to receive your "Monthly Newsletter" topic. Or create a segment that only includes leads who have not opted out of receiving commercial messages.
- **Consent: Capture and share consent across multiple lines of business by sharing consent purposes**
    - Multi-brand compliance profiles enable you to build trust in your multiple brand(s) by giving your customers control over their communication preferences tailored to each line of business. With the added ability to create new consent purposes and share those purposes across compliance profiles, you can now use the same consent captured from one profile in other profiles and their preference centers. This enables you to capture consent for a parent brand and then share that consent with each of the child brands in your organization.
- **Consent: Preference center and consent support for custom channels**
    - Preference centers in real-time journeys now support custom channels for purpose and topic-based consent. Custom channel messages can set a preference center compliance profile, purpose, and (optional) topic and real-time journeys will respect the contact point consent for those messages. Messages sent to custom channels follow the same consent enforcement rules as SMS messages.

- **Further personalize journeys using custom events with entity references**
    - Entity references for custom triggers enable greater personalization of messages sent to customers. Create entity references for custom events instead of adding multiple attributes manually, bypassing the previous limit of 30 attributes. For example, if you want to create a custom trigger that triggers a journey for all customers who purchased a specific product on your website, you can now capture the purchase event and the contents related to the SKU that was purchased. Instead of manually entering all attributes (with a maximum limit of 30) for the custom trigger, you can now add an entity reference to select as part of the custom trigger attribute definition.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Insights - Journeys        |  1.1.26671.175      |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the July 2023 release, customer consent data began migration to utilize the new multi-brand consent features. For some Customer Insights - Journeys users, the migration changed the settings that control whether tracking links are included in messages. The changes may prevent tracking in messages if customers have not given explicit consent. After the migration, if you want to enable tracking links in messages for customers who have not provided tracking consent, [update the **Tracking purpose** enforcement model](real-time-marketing-email-text-consent.md#consent-enforcement-diagram) of your **Compliance Profile(s)** to "Non-restrictive." This enables tracking links to be substituted in emails as long as the receiver has not explicitly opted out of tracking.

> [!TIP]
> Starting in July 2023, custom workflows can no longer *read* from the **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent2** or **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent3** consent tables. To ensure continued functionality, you must update custom workflows to read from the latest **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent4** table.
>
> Custom workflows that *write* to the **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent2** or **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent3** consent tables will automatically have data synced to the latest **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent4** table with some delay (potentially 24 hours or longer). If your workflows depend on data being available sooner than that, you should update your workflows to *write* to the **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent4** table. The data sync will continue until June 1, 2024, at which time you'll need to have moved all workflows that write contact point consent records to target the **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent4** table.
>
> Additionally, as of June 2023, the **Consent Type** field is mandatory for the **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent4** entity. To ensure continued functionality of custom workflows, update the workflows to include this mandatory field.

- **Confidently send emails after previewing trigger-based personalization**
    - Personalizing content is an effective strategy for boosting engagement but ensuring such personalized content is accurate for a variety of recipients can be a challenging task.

    - QR codes are widely used to share information that is easily actionable on mobile devices with just a simple scan. They are an effective tool for promoting and increasing engagement for various purposes like events, web pages, coupons, and more. The email designer already includes a feature that allows easy insertion of QR codes for commonly used targets such as events, URLs, surveys, and file downloads. Now, we've added two additional targets. The "Event registration code" target fills a gap in real-time functionality by supporting QR codes for event registration pages along with the registration code needed for check-in. The "Text" option enables you to generate a QR code for any text you type in. Additionally, you can make the QR code dynamic by using personalized data like discount codes or loyalty program membership numbers.

| Customer Insights - Journeys        |  1.1.24040.75    |

#### General availability

- **Use interaction data to improve targeting in the redesigned segment builder**
    - Segments are critical for targeting the right customers and personalizing their experience. The redesigned Customer Insights - Journeys segment builder allows you to create segments based on customer interactions and engagement with your marketing messages, websites, events, or other channels. Combined with the demographic and firmographic attributes already available for segmentation, the segment builder enables you to reach the right customers at the right time. You can then use these segments for targeting, journey branching or content variants to personalize the experience for each customer.

- **Save time by easily moving triggers between environments**
    - With Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, you can create custom triggers in development or pre-production environments to securely test the intended behavior before you use them in production for live marketing journeys and campaigns. You can then move the triggers to a production environment using Power Platform Solutions in any state. The ability to move published triggers enables you to align your testing workflow with your application lifecycle management process. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys automatically takes care of packaging the triggers and any related metadata when you export and import the solutions.

    - [Docs](move-triggers-between-environments.md)

- **Boost your productivity with enhanced journey reminders**
    - You can now create journeys that nudge and remind a customer to take a required action, such as completing an application/survey, filling a health check, checking out their cart, and more. You can remind customers until they complete the call to action or until a certain date or time. Additionally, you can bypass certain journey steps when a customer action makes them irrelevant. For instance, if you’re welcoming/onboarding the customer to a product or service through daily messages, but they complete the onboarding before all the messages have been sent – you can skip the remaining messages by exiting the customer from that block. This simplifies not only the journey logic required to capture the whole scenario in a single journey, but also makes a single block of journey actions (such as a series of reminders) easy to analyze and optimize.

- **Surface the next best action to your sales team when a lead engages with Customer Insights - Journeys**

With Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, you can now create sales activities such as tasks and phone calls directly from journeys so that leads get individualized attention when they’re most likely to engage. You can also activate a sales sequence to accelerate a deal, ensuring that sellers receive automated recommendations based on the sales playbook associated with the campaign.

- **Clearly communicate dates and times in formats that match expectations of your audience**
    - Different parts of the world use different formats for date and time, so it is critical to use the right format your audience expects to avoid confusion. We are expanding available time formats to add 12-hour formats in certain languages/countries where they officially follow 24-hour format but in practice also use 12-hour format (for example, English (UK)). We also added recently used formats at the top. Not only does this save time, it also makes it easy to pick a single consistent format across the message.
    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-predefined-dynamic-text.md#communicate-dates-and-times-in-various-formats)

- **Create segments effortlessly using everyday language with the improved query assist experience**

We've also improved the feature ensures a more intuitive experience. With these updates, you can build segments using everyday language to target the right audience without requiring deep knowledge on the back-end data model.

- **Prevent message fatigue by limiting the messages sent to a customer in a specific period**
    - Ensure that your customers receive the right message at the right moment and at the right frequency while preventing fatigue, minimizing unsubscribes, and facilitating optimal engagement with your key messages. Some customers qualify for multiple journeys and campaigns that run simultaneously, which may result in customers receiving multiple messages through one channel in a short period of time. Customers may perceive these messages as spam, which lowers their engagement. With the frequency cap feature, you can optimize engagement by controlling how many messages are sent across multiple channels over a period.

- **Measure marketing activity, web traffic, and conversion goals using automatic UTM tagging**
    - Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes help you track sources of traffic for your websites and landing pages, enabling you to attribute conversions to the right source. Customer Insights - Journeys messages can be a significant contributor to this traffic, but it is hard to track them without UTM parameters. They’re often left out entirely from the links in messages due to the time-consuming process of manually adding the tags to each link. In addition to automatically tagging all your messages with UTM parameters, you now can choose to customize your parameters so that it matches an existing UTM naming convention that your business already uses in google analytics reports. For example, you can choose UTM campaign to point to a campaign ID instead of the journey name.

- **Drive engagement with personalized content using data with one-to-many relationships**
    - Unlock even more data for personalization with ability to define dynamic text using data that requires traversing one-to-many relations. Consider a university alumni donation campaign where you would want to include the name of the college attended by each alum for driving maximum engagement. However, an alum might have attended multiple colleges in that university, resulting in a "one-to-many" relationship between student and college records. You can now define dynamic text for such data.

- **Scale your business effortlessly and define access to marketing assets**
    - Improve productivity by defining marketing asset access and visibility to match your business structure. As businesses create vast amounts of assets, organizing data according to organizational structure becomes critical. Well-organized assets are important to remaining compliant and productive.

Separating data enables you to gain comprehensive insights into a specific brand's marketing performance without losing sight of the bigger picture. Compliance risk is reduced by using out-of-the-box campaigns and data segregation capabilities across your organization.

- **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys now supports changing the organization URL in Power Platform Admin Center**
    - People often want to change the URL of the Customer Insights - Journeys application to a branded name which is easy to remember.

    - Gain insight into the unique individuals who are engaging with your journeys, rather than simply counting the number of times an email or link has been opened or clicked.

#### General availability

- **Create a static snapshot of segment membership**
    - Static segment lists are an important part of audience management for marketers. Use static segments in one-off campaigns or newsletters where it’s essential to implement segment membership based on a specific date or time. Static segments ensure that new people that become eligible for the segment won't enter the one-off journey, even if it continues to be live. You can create static snapshots no matter how the segment is built (whether it uses query conditions or manual inclusions or exclusions). The flexibility in static segment creation separates how segments are defined from how you want to update or refresh segments.

- **Fine-tune email communications with filtered lists**
    - Including an entire list in an email is a common scenario. But there are times when it's more effective to only include items from a list that meet certain conditions. For example, in a confirmation email about an order, you may need to separately list items that are back-ordered. Similarly, communication about a multi-session conference is easier to consume if the sessions are organized by topic or track. Now you can easily achieve these scenarios by simply adding a filter to your email list.

- **Seamlessly manage and embed assets into your content with an enhanced unified library**

With the enhanced unified library, you can now upload files once and use them where you need them. No need to copy or download assets for backup. Using additional file types, such as documents, PDFs, presentations, videos and more, you can now add asset links to your emails to create richer content for your customers.

    > To foster the new simplified way of managing and using assets, the [Customer Insights - Journeys library add-on](upload-images-files.md) is no longer available for installation. If you previously installed it, you could continue to use the add-on.

    - Customization of your customer journeys is now available in Dynamics 365 Real-time Customer Insights - Journeys. Not only can marketers use out-of-the-box Customer Insights - Journeys capabilities to effectively engage with their customers, but they can also now create personalized, flexible, and efficient solutions through Power Apps to better tailor the app to their specific business needs. For example, you can now extend your Real-time journey canvas to add any customized fields through Dataverse to better streamline your business processes for higher efficiency.

    - The simplified email editor with the improved template gallery allows you to create engaging content within minutes, whether you are an experienced marketer or create emails occasionally to engage with your customers. Now, you can make basic content modifications directly on canvas, and enjoy easy, delightful, and focused experience.

- **Send emails quickly without building a journey**
    - Send emails without creating a journey. This workflow allows you to select from a new template library, make changes easily with simplifications to the email editor, and send emails to the segment members you need to reach within minutes.

- **Prevent message fatigue by limiting the messages sent to a customer in a specific period**
    - Ensure that your customers receive the right message at the right moment and at the right frequency to prevent fatigue, avoid unsubscribes, and facilitate optimal engagement with your key messages. Some customers qualify for multiple journeys and campaigns that run simultaneously. This results in customers receiving multiple messages through one channel in a short period of time. Customers may perceive these messages as spam, which lowers their engagement. With the frequency cap feature, you can optimize engagement by controlling how many messages are sent across multiple channels over a period.

- **Scale your business effortlessly and define access to marketing assets**
    - Improve productivity by defining marketing asset access and visibility to match your business structure. As businesses create vast amounts of assets, organizing data according to organizational structure becomes critical. Well-organized assets are important to remaining compliant and productive. Now in Customer Insights - Journeys, you can effortlessly organize your digital assets, content, and journeys to match your organizational structure by separating business and customer data across organizational boundaries. Separating data enables you to gain comprehensive insights into a specific brand's marketing performance without losing sight of the bigger picture. Compliance risk is reduced by using out-of-the-box campaigns and data segregation capabilities across your organization.

- **Hop over one-to-many relationships for dynamic text**
    - With dynamic text data that requires traversing 1-to-many relations, unlock even more data for personalization. Consider a university alumni donation campaign where you would want to include the name of the college attended by each alum for driving maximum engagement. However, an alum might have attended multiple colleges in that university, resulting in a "1-to-many" relationship between student and college records. Dynamic text can now be defined for such data.

#### Monthly enhancement

- **Updated journey side pane**
    - The new journey side pane is designed to improve productivity and streamline your workflow by displaying all the important information upfront. The entry and exit criteria and the journey’s goal and frequency cap settings are more discoverable, making it easier for you to remember to change or update these settings without leaving the journey canvas.

### February 2023 update

This month, the new Customer Insights - Journeys segment builder is generally available. Also, a new public preview feature allows you to measure marketing activity, web traffic, and conversion goals using automatic UTM tagging.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Insights - Journeys        |  1.91.2018.0    |

#### General availability

- **Target the right audience using the new segment builder**
    - Improve your productivity by intuitively creating segments for contacts and leads in the new segment builder. To improve marketing return on investment, your segments must target the right audience. You can now build segments effortlessly by describing them in natural language (using GPT) or by using an easy drag-and-drop logic builder that doesn’t require specialized knowledge of complex data structures and logical operators. To further ensure your confidence in building segments, you can preview the members and estimate the size of draft segments as part of the creation process (within seconds for most segments). In addition, the segment builder enables you to build segments using leads. You can then target the leads directly using customer journeys for your demand generation programs.

    > ![Screenshot of a new segment builder.](media/whats-new-segment-builder.png "Screenshot of a new segment builder")

#### Public preview

- **Measure marketing activity, web traffic, and conversion goals using automatic UTM tagging**
    - Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes help you track sources of traffic for your websites and landing pages, enabling you to attribute conversions to the right source. Customer Insights - Journeys messages can be a significant contributor to this traffic, but it's hard to track them without UTM parameters. Links in messages are overlooked due to the time-consuming process of manually adding tags to each link. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys now automatically tags all your links in messages with UTM parameters, following a consistent taxonomy. This gives you full visibility into your marketing contribution to web traffic, empowering you to optimize traffic and conversions.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Customize your UTM links screenshot.](media/real-time-marketing-utm-custom.png "Customize your UTM links screenshot")

#### Monthly enhancements

- **View Total Opens and Total Clicks KPIs and interactions in Delivery and Interactions details**
    - Track the effectiveness of your customer experiences and make data-driven decisions to optimize your marketing strategies. Understanding how many people have seen a marketing message and how many people have engaged with the experience by clicking on a link can help identify which channels are driving more engagement, allowing you to make informed decisions on how to optimize your marketing strategy.
    > [!NOTE]
    > This feature includes the temporary removal of Unique clicks and Opens from Delivery and Interactions details. Unique clicks and Opens will be added back in an upcoming release.
- **Easily manage additional tables available for personalization**
    - You can use up to 50 tables for personalization in Customer Insights - Journeys (see details [here](real-time-marketing-predefined-dynamic-text.md#access-even-more-data-for-personalization)). You have control over which 50 tables to select. This selection step is easier now with additional pre-defined filters to quickly filter the tables list to all tables, tables selected by default, tables that you've selected, or tables that are in use in the current message.
- **Support for multi-line conditions in inline conditions**
    - Inline conditions are used to create HTML code for scenarios where conditional content is not appropriate such as changing one word in otherwise common content (for example, a salutation word). This user experience is now enhanced with the same condition builder experience used everywhere in the product, improving ease of use and delivering the added functionality of multi-line conditions. Learn more: [How to use inline conditions](real-time-marketing-personalize-inline-conditions.md).
- **No-code approach to adding marketing interactions to the unified timeline in custom contact/lead forms**
    - When using out-of-the-box contact/lead forms, marketing interactions based on journeys in Customer Insights - Journeys and outbound marketing are automatically populated in the unified timeline. But when marketers used custom contact/lead forms, they had to manually add the marketing interactions into the timeline by making code changes. With the February release, you can add marketing interactions to your custom contact/lead forms through a simple no-code approach by adding a custom connector to your custom forms through the Power Apps maker experience. Learn more: [How to enable marketing interactions in your contact or lead timeline](timeline.md#how-to-enable-marketing-interactions-in-your-contact-or-lead-timeline).
- **Customer Insights - Journeys interactions in the unified timeline now showcase specific links clicked by contacts/leads in messages**
    - Sales reps and customer service agents now have visibility into specific links that a contact/lead clicked in their marketing messages. Viewing the specific links helps them understand the contact/lead’s past activities at a more granular level, enabling more personalized engagement. For instance, a credit card agent in a financial services firm can now understand which credit card offer (among many) a contact clicked on in a promotional message, allowing them to make a personalized follow-up call.

## 2022 updates

### December 2022 update

For the December 2022 release, general availability features include custom channels that allow you to extend your outreach in Customer Insights - Journeys, date and time formatting flexibility for different locales, and access to more personalization data. Public preview features include Customer Insights - Journeys lead capture forms that convert visitors into customers and filtering for email lists.

Starting this month, we'll highlight recently published blogs and scenario documentation in addition to the product docs that support the newly released features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release brings changes to the Customer Insights - Journeys consent system and underlying Dataverse tables. This change only impacts users who have customized code that directly reads or writes to the **msdynkmt_compliancesettings** or **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent2** Dataverse tables. As part of the upgrade to this release, any user who enables the [Preview: Create and manage Customer Insights - Journeys forms](real-time-marketing-form-overview.md) feature will have their consent data automatically migrated to use the new tables. Most users will not need to take any action in response to this change.
>
> Users who have code that directly interacts with the **msdynkmt_compliancesettings** and **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent2** Dataverse tables will need to make changes after this release to direct their code to read/write to the new **msdynkmt_compliancesettings3** and **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent3** Dataverse tables.
>
> To aid in the transition, we will continuously scan for new rows written to the to-be-deprecated **msdynmkt_contactpointconsent2** tables and automatically copy them to new **msdynkmt_compliancesettings3** tables. Copies may take up to 48 hours to complete. We will disable this automatic copy in a future release.
>
> In the future, all users will be migrated to make use of these new tables. For the time being, only users who have opted into the Customer Insights - Journeys forms preview will have their data automatically migrated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of December 2022, consent enforcement for real-time customer journeys for **Contacts** was changed to require opt-in for emails sent using the **Restrictive** consent enforcement model. If you continue using the **Restrictive** enforcement setting, this change will result in emails not being sent from Real-time marketing journeys to Contacts who have not opted in. This change will not impact outbound marketing journeys.
>
> To revert to the previous behavior, you can change your consent enforcement model to **Non-restrictive**. Alternatively, if you have previously captured consent on **contact** records in outbound marketing, you can **Load consent** to populate the contact point consent records used to enforce consent in Customer Insights - Journeys. Learn more: [Manage consent for email and text messages in Customer Insights - Journeys](real-time-marketing-email-text-consent.md).

#### General availability features

- **Extend your outreach with custom channels**
    - Extend Customer Insights - Journeys using the communication channels you're familiar with to engage your customers in moments that matter. Use Customer Insights - Journeys personalization, consent, and analytics tools to create compelling content and deliver it over your preferred communication channels such as a local SMS provider or WhatsApp. Capitalize on proven channels, plug any of them into your new or existing journeys, and unfold their true potential with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys to maximize customer engagement.

- **Communicate dates and times in a variety of formats**
    - When working in multiple geographies and languages, communicating dates and times clearly requires using a format that matches the recipient's expectations. To make sure your customers always receive the correct information, Customer Insights - Journeys supports a variety of date and time formats. Whenever dynamic text is defined using a "datetime" type attribute, an additional set of options becomes available to select a date/time format that is readable and consistent with the locale (language and region) of the audience. If desired, you can also change the locale, and time zone to match the audience. The Customer Insights - Journeys app then automatically converts the stored date/time to the selected time zone.

- **Access even more data to personalize your customer outreach**
    - You're no longer limited to accessing Dataverse tables that are directly related to an Audience or Triggers. Now, you can access any Dataverse table to include information in your communications. For example, for a product launch email, you may want to include product information, image, and SKU number. Such details may be available in a Product table, which you can now use for personalization.

#### Public preview

- **Create lead capture forms that convert visitors to customers**
    - Now in Customer Insights - Journeys, create modern website forms that capture your customers' attention while allowing them to enter their data. Use the drag-and-drop editor to create forms that collect marketing data, convert visitors into leads, and convert leads into paying customers. With the new form editor, you can create robust forms without relying on complex code and developers.

    > ![Screenshot of lead capture forms.](media/whats-new-lead-capture-forms.png "Screenshot of lead capture forms")

- **Fine-tune email communications with filtered lists**
    - Including an entire list in an email is a common scenario. But there are times when it's more effective to only include items from a list that meet certain conditions. For example, in a confirmation email about an order, you may need to separately list items that are back ordered. Similarly, communication about a multi-session conference is easier to consume if the sessions are organized by topic or track. Now you can easily achieve these scenarios by simply adding a filter to your email list.

    > ![Screenshot of personalize lists.](media/whats-new-personalize-lists.png "Screenshot of personalize lists")

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Real-time marketing journeys**
    - Delete journeys in Customer Insights - Journeys directly from list view and remove unused or abandoned journeys. Maintain full control of your journey list and focus on the right journeys when you need them.
    - Tailor your user experience by disabling create and edit functionality for journeys on mobile devices.
- **Real-time segment builder**
    - Create segments using more attributes that are indirectly related to the Contact or Lead. For example, you can use attributes like the event sessions a Contact has checked into in a conference or webinar they attended. Use attributes from Dataverse tables that have up to five degrees of separation from the Contact or Lead table (up from three previously).

### October 2022 update

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys's 2022 wave 2 release has arrived! The October 2022 update has six general availability features and four public previews from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). The general availability features include advanced personalized content blocks, the ability to make quick updates and manage version control for journeys, brand profiles that allow you to easily manage content across multiple brands, the ability to test all custom triggers before using them in a journey with real customers, QR codes in emails for coupons and events, and feature-rich links in emails for websites, surveys, events, marketing pages, Microsoft Teams events, and calendar items.

The public preview features include custom channels that allow you to extend your outreach in Customer Insights - Journeys, natural language segment creation in Customer Insights - Journeys, static segments in Customer Insights - Journeys, and the ability to create segments in Customer Insights - Journeys where specific people are always included or excluded.

Monthly improvements include updates to personalization, segmentation, and text messaging capabilities.

#### Version number

#### General availability feature

- **Drive engagement at scale with highly tailored audience-specific content**
    - Conditional content helps deliver highly tailored content to drive engagement. Make the conditional content reusable by saving it in a content block. Anyone on your team can then reuse these advanced personalized content blocks in different messages to achieve personalization at scale with ease and efficiency. Use cases for advanced personalized content blocks include differentiated company contact information, depending on the recipient's location; varying offers, depending on loyalty program membership levels; delivering required legal text in the language that matches the recipient's language preference; and, a content block that delivers different discounts (for example, 10%, 20%, or 30% off) using unique criteria to qualify each recipient.

- **Make incremental updates and optimize journeys while analyzing all past versions**
    - Editing journeys is now easier and more collaborative. You can now make light edits to live journeys, such as renaming elements and adjusting goal percentages without creating new versions. Also, because the Customer Insights - Journeys app automatically version-tracks each update, you can make complex and structural changes to journeys confidently and collaboratively with your team. This makes editing journeys as simple as editing documents; each change is tracked and is available for auditing.

- **Easily manage content across multiple brands in the email designer**
    - Brand profiles allow you to manage different brands easily. Reduce content-related errors by defining default senders for emails and default social links. Extend your brand profile entity with custom values that you can use when creating content. Create multiple profiles for your organization as well as for each of your business units.

    > ![Screenshot of brand profiles.](media/whats-new-brandprofile.png "Screenshot of brand profiles.")

- **Test all paths customers take before publishing journeys**
    - Testing custom triggers before using them in a journey is the safest way to ensure that your expectations meet the customer's reality. The test send feature gives you reassurance in the quality and behavior of your custom triggers before you send them to your audience. To test your custom triggers, you can run internal users through the journey to determine if your triggers work correctly and validate the path that your customers will take.

- **Increase customer engagement with QR codes in emails**
    - Increase customer engagement and promote your business using QR codes for events or coupons. QR codes allow your customers to access marketing event information or dynamic links with just a single scan! QR codes work by simply scanning the code with a mobile device that is equipped with a camera and QR code reader application. Once the QR code is scanned, it is translated into actionable information such as a webpage or event check-in.

- **Use natural language to create segments in Customer Insights - Journeys**
    - Segment creation traditionally required extensive knowledge of the complex data structures defined by your business. Now, instead of selecting specific data tables manually, you can use natural language to create segments in Customer Insights - Journeys by simply describing the segment definition in plain English. This flexible experience lets you add the results query onto the segment builder at any level of the query logic, either as a new group or as an additional condition in your existing logic. You can improve the natural language engine by giving thumbs-up or down feedback so that it can help you achieve even more accurate results in the future.

- **Create a static snapshot of segment membership**
    - Static segment lists are an important part of audience management for marketers. Use static segments in one-off campaigns or newsletters where it's essential to implement segment membership based on a specific date or time. Static segments ensure that new people that become eligible for the segment will not enter the one-off journey, even if it continues to be live. You can create static snapshots no matter how the segment is built (whether it uses query conditions or manual inclusions or exclusions). The flexibility in static segment creation separates how segments are defined from how you want to update or refresh segments.

- **Create a segment where specific people are always included or excluded**
    - Adding manual inclusions or exclusions is a powerful way to augment segment building criteria. Manually include or exclude specific people to ensure segments always reach VIP customers, or just as an easy way to build test segments for journeys.

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Personalization**
    - While conditional content can be used for selecting the right image in a lot of scenarios, there are times when it is more natural to use a dynamic URL that comes from a Contact or some other entity when the content designer doesn't have the visibility into (or doesn't want to be involved in) how images are selected. Personalization is now supported in image URL boxes in the email designer, allowing you to use dynamic URLs for images.
- **Segmentation**
    - **[Preview]** You no longer must rely on admins to select data tables to be synced into the Customer Insights - Journeys app to get started with segmentation. In Customer Insights - Journeys, instead of waiting for admins to add data tables under **Dataset Configurations** in the **Settings** area, you can add tables to be used for creating segments to the list in the building experience itself.
        - [Docs](real-time-marketing-sync-data-tables.md)
    - **[Preview]** Build segments using multiple query logic groups. This opens more segment scenarios and more enriched segment definitions, such as "Contacts whose accounts are managed by partners in Contoso Consultants *but not* preferred to be contacted by phone".

### September 2022 update

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys September 2022 update has one general availability feature from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). The general availability feature—conditional dynamic content—enables marketers to create personalized messaging more quickly and easily. Monthly enhancements include improvements to personalization and triggers.

Additionally, Customer Insights - Journeys features are now available in France and Switzerland, completing geographical parity between Customer Insights - Journeys and outbound marketing features.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |

#### General availability feature

- **Win customer attention by creating conditional dynamic content with easy-to-use no-code experiences**
    - Conditional dynamic content is key to delivering highly personalized messages to customers. Creating content where entire sections target specific customer segments allows you to craft messages that align with your customers' interests and preferences, driving engagement and brand loyalty. Until now, achieving this level of dynamic content was complex and required coding. With the new conditional content experience, marketers can easily create messages targeted to specific segments or attributes, bringing content that is truly unique to each customer without writing any code.

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Personalization**
    - **[Preview]** Access even more data for personalization and fine-tune your customer outreach. In previous releases, you were limited to accessing Dataverse tables that were directly related to an Audience or Triggers. Now, you can access many additional commonly used Dataverse tables, such as Events.
- **Triggers**
    - Testing triggers before using them in a journey is the safest way to ensure that your expectations meet the customer's reality. The test send feature gives you reassurance in the quality and behavior of your custom triggers before you send them to your audience. For example, when you create an abandoned cart journey, you can use the test send feature to ensure that your "cart abandoned" custom trigger behaves as expected.
        - [Docs](real-time-marketing-test-triggers.md)
- **Real-time marketing geo expansion**
    - Real-time marketing features are now available in all geographies where Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys is available. You can find a list of geographies on [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform availability](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/availability-reports/).

### August 2022 update

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys August 2022 update has one general availability feature from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). It also includes a public preview from [2022 wave 2 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave2/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/). The general availability feature is a new email creation canvas and user experience. The public preview feature allows you to use AI-powered content ideas to kickstart email creation, now with built-in default data so you don't have to create dozens of emails to get started.

Additionally, this update includes improvements to real-time journeys and personalization.

#### General availability feature

    - The reimagined email editor is optimized for a productive workflow, allowing you to quickly create engaging and relevant content.

#### Preview feature

- **Boost your creativity with AI-powered email content ideas**
    - Content ideas help you find writing inspiration. You can use content ideas as a starting point when creating email content—it's like asking a group of colleagues to brainstorm with you. Content ideas make creating emails simpler, more efficient, and fun. It's a new and innovative functionality with the latest AI technologies (GPT-3 language model) behind the scenes. Now, content ideas includes default email content data, allowing users to get up and running even quicker.

    > ![Screenshot of content ideas feature.](media/whats-new-content-ideas.png "Screenshot of content ideas feature")

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Real-time journeys**
    - Deliver more personalized experiences by accessing a richer set of trigger data for defining the journey entry/exit criteria, conditions/branches, and waits. When you add any of these elements to the journey, you will now be able to see data attributes not only from the trigger's core entity/table, but also from entities/tables directly related to those attributes. For example, when creating a journey to nurture new opportunities (using the "Opportunity created" trigger), you can branch the journey based on the "budget" attribute from the Opportunity table. This enables you to create journey variations for opportunities that are more likely to buy.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Screenshot of trigger data feature.](media/whats-new-trigger-data.png "Screenshot of trigger data feature")

    - Multiple branch journeys now include a detailed analytics view. The detailed analytics view for the attribute branch allows you to see a preview of journey audience details such as name, ID, type, and time. This helps you gain additional insights into how the journey is executing.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

- **Personalization**
    - Conditional content (preview) enhancements: Preview and test send now remove content variations that are not possible. You can also give the default a name (like other variations) to help explain situations where the content will be used.

### July 2022 update

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys July 2022 update has four general availability features and one pubic preview from the [2022 wave 1 release plans](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/).

The general availability features include reusable content blocks for quick email creation, the ability to continue customer conversations by taking action on text message replies, multiple journey branches to create more personalized variations, and a new channel analytics dashboard to track delivery and engagement metrics across multiple channels.

The public preview features include the ability to edit live journeys with improved version tracking capabilities for journeys in Customer Insights - Journeys and brand profiles including custom sender profiles, social links, and custom fields for better branding consistency within organizations.

The update also includes improvements to real-time journeys, the text message channel, and event management.

#### General availability enhancements

- **Quickly create emails with enhanced reusable content blocks**
    - Content blocks are reusable pieces of content that let you easily assemble rich and consistent emails. New and enhanced content blocks are now available in outbound and Customer Insights - Journeys. The enhanced content blocks can include all standard elements such as text, images, and buttons, as well as custom layouts and personalization.

- **Continue the conversation with your customers by taking action on their text message replies**
    - Text messaging allows you to quickly communicate with customers. But it's not enough to just send messages out, you also need to act on text message responses. Now, you can interact with your customers by creating journeys based on their replies to your text messages. Create custom keywords and add them to your messages and journey branches to continue the conversation with your customers.

- **Create more personalized journey variations using multiple journey branches**
    - Journey branches let you create personalized journeys for customers, engaging them in different ways based on who they are and their past actions. Create more than two branches at any given step in the journey—creating more fine-grained personalization and engaging each customer differently based on their unique profile and behavioral signals. This eliminates the need to nest branches and makes analyzing journeys easier. Merge the branches back so that customers can continue the common journey steps after going through their specialized branches.

- **Measure campaign effectiveness with a new channel analytics dashboard**
    - To create effective campaigns, you need to continuously track asset delivery across multiple channels. You also need to review campaign engagement metrics so that you can make improvements where needed. With the new out-of-the-box aggregated channel analytics dashboard in Customer Insights - Journeys, you can track important delivery and engagement metrics at any level of aggregation—across all channels, journeys, and marketing assets. Zoom in on a particular channel or individual message. Identify trends over a specified time period to further improve your marketing efforts.

#### Preview features

- **Edit, publish, and optimize journeys by making incremental updates, while tracking and analyzing all previous versions together**
    - Improved journey version tracking and editing. Make light edits to live journeys&mdash;such as renaming elements and adjusting goal percentages&mdash;without creating new versions. Because the Customer Insights - Journeys app automatically version tracks each update, you can make complex and structural changes to journeys confidently and collaboratively with your team. This makes editing journeys as simple as editing documents; each change is tracked and is available for auditing. Customers who are mid-flight in journeys are not impacted. Mid-flight customers can continue going through the journey version they entered while all new customers experience the journey with the latest updates. Copies are no longer created each time a change is made, leaving you with an uncluttered view of your journey list. Analytics are preserved for each version. This enables you to compare journey flow and goal attainment across journey versions.

- **Personalize interactions using a unified view of customer activity across Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, Dynamics 365 Sales, and Dynamics 365 Customer Service**
    - Sales reps and customer service agents use the Dynamics 365 unified timeline to view their customers' past activities so they can personalize engagement. Now, reps and agents can also view real-time and outbound marketing activities in the Dynamics 365 unified timeline. The timeline allows filtering based on the specific type(s) of activity or interactions. The timeline also allows previews of individual messages sent to customers. Message previews enable, for instance, loan agents in a financial services firm to know what document request was made to a loan applicant in a previous email so that the agent can quickly find the right document.

- **Trigger journeys based on data changes in any Dynamics 365 app to engage customers at the right time without writing any code**
    - Interactions in any Dynamics 365 app can be used to trigger and drive customer journeys without requiring developers or customizations. Customers interact with several departments and functions in companies throughout their lifetime, all of which use their own CRM, ERP, and business apps. Each of these interactions, such as a service ticket being closed, represents an opportunity to engage more deeply with your customers. Data no longer has to remain siloed within separate apps and out of reach of your customer engagement or marketing automation tools.

    - Fixed an internal server error that sometimes occurred when creating a segment and going live with it.
- **Marketing emails**
    - Improved security in the email editor (updated components address potential cross-site scripting and information disclosure vulnerabilities).

#### General availability enhancements

- **Use outbound subscription centers in real-time journeys**
    - Collecting consent is a critical business need. Subscription centers are a way to gather consent preferences from your customers. Businesses need to be able to customize their subscription center to match their branding and business needs. They also need the ability to create different subscription centers for different regions, brands, or lines of business. Now, you can bring the flexibility of subscription centers available in outbound marketing to journeys in Customer Insights - Journeys, enabling you to have multiple subscription centers, customized and branded to your needs.

#### Preview features

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it's officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren't meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality.
> 
> Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won't be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren't meant for production use, especially to process personal data or other data that are subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.

- **Create emails faster with precise drag-and-drop, in-context menu, and easy-select interactions**
    - The reimagined email editor is optimized for a productive workflow, allowing you to quickly create engaging and relevant content. With this release, the editor is further enhanced with precise drag-and-drop interactions, easy selection of elements, columns, or sections, and an in-context menu for faster content creation so you can create pixel-perfect emails in minutes.

    - [Docs](create-marketing-email.md)

- **Personalize interactions using a unified view of customer activity across Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, Sales, and Customer Service**
    - Sales and Customer Service agents use the Dynamics 365 unified timeline to view their customers' past activities so they can personalize engagement. Now, these agents can also view real-time and outbound marketing activities in the Dynamics 365 unified timeline. The timeline allows filtering based on the specific type(s) of activity or interactions. It also allows previews of messages sent to customers. This enables, for instance, loan agents in a financial services firm to know what document request was made to a loan applicant in a previous email so that the agent can quickly find the right document.

- **Quickly create emails with enhanced reusable content blocks**
    - Content blocks are reusable pieces of content that let you easily assemble rich and consistent emails. New and enhanced content blocks are now available in outbound and Customer Insights - Journeys. The enhanced content blocks can include all standard elements such as text, images, and buttons, as well as custom layouts and personalization.

#### General availability enhancements

- **Create individualized journeys by adding conditions based on attributes captured as part of the event trigger**
    - Previously, marketers had to instrument fine-grained triggers for their journeys. For instance, they needed separate triggers for each campaign page if they wanted to create a unique journey per campaign. Now, marketers can simply ask their web developers to add a single trigger across all campaign pages. They can then use filter conditions on the trigger to spawn a unique journey per campaign page. This gives marketers more control over how they use triggers and enables them to create future journeys without needing new triggers every time. Trigger conditions are even more powerful when combined with out-of-the-box triggers such as marketing form filled or event registration, as marketers can now scope a journey to a specific form or marketing event using a single out-of-the-box trigger. Trigger filters can also be added at exits, branches, or to measure journey goals.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/create-individualized-journeys-adding-conditions-based-attributes-captured-as-part-event-trigger)

- **Take action with your customers in more ways by raising triggers from a journey to run another journey or Power Automate flow**
    - Marketers can trigger journeys as well as Power Automate flows directly from anywhere in their journey. When used to trigger other journeys, this allows marketers to chain journeys together and create multiple journeys that logically function together. Likewise, when used with a Power Automate flow, marketers can run any custom process outside of their journey or connect to myriad Power Automate connectors.

    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-custom-actions.md)

- **Improved email layout templates for faster content creation**
    - Default layout templates have been replaced with popular and useful layouts allowing marketers to easily kick-start the email creation process. The templates have a modern look and feel for a better experience. They include simplified guidance with more descriptive and actionable content placeholders.
    - [Release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/marketing/dynamics365-marketing/improved-email-layout-templates-faster-content-creation)
    - [Docs](email-templates.md)

- **Easily author personalized content using pre-defined dynamic text without the need to understand the data model**
    - With pre-defined dynamic text, marketers have a quick list of the most commonly used dynamic text to select from. Marketers can simply select and insert the pre-defined text into an email to personalize it. Marketers familiar with the data model can create and share additional dynamic text so that the rest of the team can focus on authoring content rather than learning database concepts. Not only does this promote ease of use, but it also customizes the list with dynamic text that's specific to individual businesses.

    - [Docs](real-time-marketing-predefined-dynamic-text.md)

- **Quickly create customer journeys triggered by marketing interactions such as webinar check-ins and form submissions**
    - New out-of-the-box triggers allow you to create customer journeys triggered by marketing interactions such as webinar check-ins and form submissions. This eliminates the need to create and manage hundreds or thousands of segments and journeys. Now, you can use one trigger per a form and marketing event. A single journey can replace them all – and dynamic content can be used to tailor the outgoing messages to the respective form or marketing event.

- **Connect Dynamics 365 Customer Insights with customer journey orchestration when using your own data lake**
    - Use Dynamics 365 Customer Insights data, such as customer profile and segment information, that is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage in the same way you do today with standard Customer Insights connected to Microsoft Dataverse.

#### Monthly enhancements

##### Real-time marketing

> [!Note]
> "Event triggers" are now called "triggers" in the app and the documentation. The change was made to avoid confusion when referencing event management functionality versus triggering journeys in Customer Insights - Journeys.

- **Marketing emails**
    - Link buttons or images to URLs, surveys, events, marketing pages, or files. You can also create button or image links that allow recipients to join a Microsoft Teams event or that create a new calendar item.

    > ![Screenshot of link options for Customer Insights - Journeys email.](media/real-time-marketing-email-button2.png "Screenshot of link options for Customer Insights - Journeys email")

- **Personalization**
    - Now, you can personalize both an email and the customer's journey relative to important milestones (such as order date or an upcoming appointment) by creating content variations and branches that use relative and partial dates when defining a condition using dates. Partial dates allow you to define conditions such as "Birthday is today" and relative dates allow you to define conditions such as "Birthday is next month." So, depending on when an email goes out and how close it is to someone's birthday, a different offer can be shown. Learn more: [Personalize content](real-time-marketing-personalize-inline-conditions.md#partial-and-relative-dates-in-conditional-content).

#### Bug fixes

- **Channel optimization (Customer Insights - Journeys)**
    - Channel optimization will not recommend a channel which a customer has not consented to. If no channel has consent, no communication will be sent out and the customer will progress to the next step in the journey. Learn more: [Manage user compliance settings](real-time-marketing-compliance-settings.md).
- **First run experience**
    - Resolved an issue during provisioning that ocassionally caused the user interface to get stuck in a refresh state.
- **Marketing pages**
    - Fixed a form capture error that occurred when the URL to capture ended with a period. For example, *contoso.com/form.".
    - Resolved a form capture error that resulted when a URL had more than 1024 characters.
    - Session cookies are now changed (instead of being grouped together) after 20 minutes of activity (the default marketing page setting). Learn more about cookie settings: [Set up website tracking and read results](track-online-behavior.md#set-up-website-tracking-and-read-results).

- **Quickly personalize emails using predefined dynamic text, without the need to know the underlying data structure**

- **Take action with your customers in more ways by raising triggers from a journey to run another journey or Power Automate flow**
    - Use custom triggers to link between journeys and between journeys and custom processes. A new journey tile will raise a trigger at any point in a customer journey. Any journey or Power Automate flows connected to the trigger run immediately run when a customer reaches the tile. This includes triggers used in exit criteria, goals, and if/then branches for journeys.

#### Monthly enhancements

##### Real-time marketing

- **Customer journeys**
    - Create customer journeys more quickly by defining only the minimum entry criteria when making a new journey.
    - Include multiple suppression segments in a journey, fine-tuning where users exit the journey.
    - Stop and edit custom events even if they are used in live journeys.
    - Developers can now include a unique identifier to correlate triggers between journeys. For example, if a customer places multiple, separate orders, multiple order confirmation journeys would be triggered. Previously, if the customer cancelled one of the orders (triggering an order cancellation event), they would receive cancellation emails from both order journeys they were a part of. Now, a developer can insert a correlation identifier into the trigger for each unique order. The identifier ensures that only the journey occurrence tied to the cancelled order sends the cancellation email. Learn more: [Correlate across custom triggers](real-time-marketing-correlate-triggers.md).
- **Marketing emails**
    - Add feature-rich links to emails by directly linking to documents stored in the asset library.
    - Link buttons and images to existing events and marketing pages in the Customer Insights - Journeys app database without looking up the specific URL.

    - Core CSS styles have been separated from customer CSS styles to improve rendering.
    - Resolved an error that caused local configs to fail when the remote configuration service is down.
    - Fixed an error that caused previously deduplicated contacts to be removed from deduplication storage after a failure and rollback.
    - Resolved an error related to custom envelope-from emails that caused "sync bounce" emails to resend as "remote bounce" emails, causing inaccurate email error reports.

#### Version number

| App              | GA release      |

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Customer journeys**
    - Improved handling of publishable entities in live customer journeys.
- **Marketing forms**
    - Lookup support in marketing page-hosted and externally hosted forms.
    - Multi-option list support in marketing page-hosted and externally hosted forms.
- **Recurring events**
    - Recurring event instances now show a list of other recurring events in the same series in a sub grid, simplifying navigation. Recurring event series records show a list of all events in the series. There is also a new calendar view for recurring event series records.
    - Custom fields and publish statuses now copy over from recurring event series records to each recurring event instance record.
    - Recurring events are no longer locked down when in the "going live" state. Now, if you would like to immediately publish your recurring series to your website, you can do so. Additionally, you can change the recurrence pattern for already created events.
- **Segment management**
    - You no longer need to create compound dynamic segments to combine behavioral and demographic data. Segments are now categorized as dynamic or static.
    - Static segments are redesigned. Static segments now handle an unlimited number of total contacts (up to 10,000 at a time) and allow rule-based addition to list members.
    - You can select static segment contacts based on query and segment data.
    - Segments are time zone-aware, mirroring the time zone functionality in customer journeys.
    - This release also incorporates a new partial date operator. Partial dates allow you to create segments for events such as "today" or people doing an action on the first day of the month, rather than specifying exact dates.

## 2019 updates

### December 2019 update

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys December 2019 update includes the previously announced send-now feature, plus several improvements for existing features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

#### Improved segmentation performance

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys now evaluates segment membership much more quickly than before. For simple segments, we now offer near-real-time evaluation. Complex segments, such as those that use relations or the TRAVERSE operator, are now processed up to four times faster. You'll now be able to see the full contact list on the **Members** tab much sooner than previously after going live with the segment.

#### Export dynamic segment members to Excel

You can now export the contacts that are members of a dynamic segment straight to an Excel file and with just a few clicks, no matter how large the segment is. To do it, open a live, dynamic segment, select **Related** > **Contacts** to add a **Contacts** tab; then select **Export Contacts** from the command bar for that tab and choose the Excel format you would like.

![Export segment members to Excel.](media/export-segment-members.png "Export segment members to Excel")

More information: [Export dynamic segment members to Excel](segments-export-members.md)

#### Template gallery for segments

You can now create a library of templates to make it fast and easy to create any of a variety commonly used segment queries. To help get you started, we provide a collection of common queries right out of the box, each of which provides both an example and a starting point for creating your own queries. Start by selecting a template that resembles the query you want to make, then customize as needed.

![Segment template gallery.](media/segment-template-gallery.png "Segment template gallery")

Each time you create a new segment you'll be presented with the **Segment templates** gallery, which resembles the galleries already provided for many other types of entities. Here you can browse, filter, search, and learn more about each listed template. Select **Cancel** to skip the templates and go to the standard new-segment hub, where you can select a basic segment type to build from scratch (as with previous versions of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys).

To create your own templates, you can save any existing segment as a template. Or go to **Outbound marketing** > **Marketing templates** > **Segment templates** to browse, edit, or remove existing templates.

More information: [Work with segment templates](segments-templates.md)

#### Add visual labels to templates in the template galleries

When you design a new marketing email, page, form, or segment you are first presented with a gallery of templates to choose from. Now, you can add an eye-catching visual label to any template to make it easier to find and identify when browsing the gallery and other displays. For displays that use the tile view, each label appears as a colorful overlay for each relevant template. For displays using the grid view (list view), the labels can be displayed as column values, where they also show their configured colored background.

System customizers can create as many labels as you need, and define the display text and background color for each of them. In the following screenshot, you can see a tile view of marketing-page templates labeled with "New", "Old", and "VIP".

![Template gallery with labels in tile view.](media/template-label-example.png "Template gallery with labels in tile view")

More information: [Add visual labels for templates](email-templates.md#add-visual-labels-for-templates)

#### Quickly design and deliver a marketing email with _send now_

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys provides a flexible and powerful framework for designing interactive email campaigns comprised of target segments, marketing email messages, customer-journey automation, and more. But sometimes, when all you want to do is write a quick marketing email with simple personalization and send it to a few selected recipients, all of these extra components and capabilities can just get in the way. In this situation, use the new _send now_ feature, which lets you design an email as usual and then just select **Send now** to choose your recipients and deliver the message.

In the background, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys creates a static segment to contain your recipients, and a customer journey preconfigured to send your message to that segment. The journey goes live automatically and starts sending right away. After this, you can open the generated customer journey to view results and insights as usual. Both the segment and the journey that are generated by this feature are easy to identify because Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys assigns them the same name as the email message that generated them.

More information: [Quickly design and deliver a marketing email with](email-quick-send.md)

#### Add background images to sections in emails, forms, and pages

Section elements are used to establish the basic layout of your emails, marketing pages, and marketing forms. Each section offers a collection of formatting options, which already included options such as columns, background color, border style, padding, and margin. To this we now add the ability to show a background image, including fitting options such as stretch-to-fit and horizontal/vertical positioning. You can choose any image uploaded to the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys image gallery, or specify an external image-source URL.

![Section-element style settings.](media/section-element-bg.png "Section-element style settings")

More information: [Section (layout) elements](content-blocks.md)

#### Preview: Set static expiry dates for email tiles in a customer journey

Some of your customer journeys may include email messages with time-sensitive content, such as a time-limited offer, holiday promotional, or a two-week reminder for an upcoming event. Because contacts might join the journey at any time, you can now prevent delivering outdated information by setting an expiration date for one or more selected email messages. Any contact who enters an email tile after its expiration date has past will simply pass through that tile without being sent the message.

![Journey email-tile expiration settings.](media/journey-email-expire.png "Journey email-tile expiration settings")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a preview feature, which means that it's available on all updated instances, but is turned off by default and shouldn't be enabled on production instances. Admins can easily enable or disable it as needed. See [the documentation](email-expire.md) for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this preview release, the feature may sometimes still deliver a message up to six days after the expiry date. This is due to delays and retries built into the delivery system, and should occur only extremely rarely. We expect to remove this possibility entirely for the final release. Additionally, you should only use this feature with commercial messages (not transactional messages).

More information: [Preview: Set expiration dates for selected email tiles in a customer journey](email-expire.md)

#### View form-visit and form-submission insights for marketing websites

The _marketing websites_ feature generates a JavaScript code that you can add to your website pages if you'd like to track page visits for use in reporting, contact evaluation, lead scoring, and more.

The feature already provided a list of page visits, each associated with a contact when possible (for known contacts with the right cookie). Now the feature also provides separate insights for visits to pages that include a marketing form, and for each submission of each form. The feature tracks both embedded and captured forms.

![Website form-submissions insights.](media/website-form-submit-insights.png "Website form-submissions insights")

More information: [Analyze results to gain insights from your marketing activities](insights.md)

#### Edit and resubmit forms to correct for errors or failures

Customer Insights - Journeys form records already provided a **Failed submissions** tab, where you could see each time the form was submitted but couldn't be processed--typically due to a technical issue, such as a non-existing ID for an option-set. Now we've made it possible to open any failed submission, correct any obvious data issues, and then resubmit it for processing.

We've also renamed this tab to **Form submissions** because now we've made it possible to include successfully processed submissions here too (optional). This lets you edit any failed _or successful_ submission and then resubmit it to update your database with or without generating a new interaction record for the resubmission.

![Edit and resubmit form submissions.](media/form-resubmit.png "Edit and resubmit form submissions")

> [!NOTE]
> You can always review successful, processed submissions by going to the **Insights** tab and opening the **Submissions** panel, but you can't resubmit from there.

More information: [Edit and resubmit form submissions](failed-submissions.md)

#### Bug fixes

- Customer journeys: The schedule tile now consistently holds contacts until the next permitted time window arrives.
- Customer Insights - Journeys email designer: The designer now gracefully handles an HTML error that can occur when image element content is edited using the HTML editor.
- Customer Insights - Journeys email designer: When using certain templates, the email designer no longer fails to save changes and thereafter show a blank page.
- Customer Insights - Journeys email designer: The designer now correctly processes multiple undo/redo commands.
- Customer Insights - Journeys email designer: When you change the **Hero image** using the **Style** settings for a message based on a supplied template, the delivered message now shows the updated image (previously, the original hero image was sometimes delivered instead).
- Email dynamic content: You can now include dynamic expressions that use two single quotes, one after the other (previously, these would be reduced to just one single quote).
- Email A/B testing: Undo and redo commands now work correctly when editing the A and B versions of an email-body test.
- Content blocks: Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys instances that don't have marketing services installed (also known as _disconnected instances_) now correctly show content blocks as in draft state and correctly display the warning that marketing services are unavailable.
- Marketing pages: Users are now warned if they try to make changes to a live marketing page that could result in a blank page or a page where the form was removed.
- Marketing forms: You can now edit and submit form designs that were created by a user that has been deleted from the system.
- Form capture: Forms that include drop-down list values containing whitespace are now captured correctly
- Lead scoring: You can now include apostrophes in expression values for lead-scoring rules (they will be correctly escaped automatically).
- Segment designer: You can now create segments that find records with null values in two-option fields.
- Event website: Custom registration fields no longer show in-field placeholder text that matches the label (to avoid displaying long, repeated text in the form).

### November 2019 update

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys November 2019 update provides several improvements for existing features, plus performance improvements and bug fixes.

#### A/B testing improvements

The A/B testing feature now freezes all test results when the test is finished. That means that when you're reviewing your A/B test KPIs, results, and insights, you'll only see information about what occurred during the test period (not afterwards).

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Email A/B testing](/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-marketing/email-ab-testing) (feature announcement)
- [Design and run A/B tests on your email designs](email-a-b-testing.md) (documentation)

#### Segmentation improvements

Segments now support many-to-many (N:N) relationships for custom entities, which means you can define segmentation criteria on entities that relate back to contacts through these types of relationships in addition to 1:N and N:1 relationships. Previously, a few specific N:N relationships were supported (such as between contacts and marketing lists), but these were hard-coded for specific scenarios. Now you can use N:N relationships in custom scenarios too.

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Improved segmentation experience](/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-marketing/improved-segmentation-experience) (feature announcement)
- [Working with segments](segmentation-lists-subscriptions.md) (documentation)

#### Customer journey insights improvements

Customer journeys provide detailed information about what occurred during the journey. Among the results presented on the **Insights** tab is the **Incomplete journey** panel, where you can see information about contacts who were stopped during the journey and emails that we blocked from being sent. Emails might be blocked for any of several reasons, which are listed here. For the November release, we've added an entry for **Other reasons**, where blocked emails that don't fall into any of the other available categories will be listed together with information about what happened.

For more information about this feature, see:

- [Customer journey insights](insights.md#customer-journey-insights) (documentation)

#### Bug fixes

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys November 2019 update includes the following bug fixes:

- Installation and setup: The Dynamics 365 setup wizard now succeeds when some or all workflows, plugins, and/or entities were created by a now disabled or unlicensed user.
- Marketing pages: For double opt-in, content settings are now correctly validated to identify missing confirmation settings.
- Marketing pages: Test domains are no longer checked against block listed providers.
- Marketing pages: Subscription-center forms now correctly handle the "Do not bulk email me" option when presented either as a radio button or as a check box.
- Marketing pages: Form-submission error feedback is now customizable via JavaScript.
- Email marketing: Error checking now functions correctly when date/time fields are referenced in dynamic content.
- Customer journeys: Individual marketing lists can now be reused across multiple customer journeys.
- Websites: For website insights, the **Timeline** display has been renamed to **Visits**.
- Customer Insights: Deleted contacts now sync correctly and more quickly.
