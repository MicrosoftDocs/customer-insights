# Transition channels & message sending

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The [outbound marketing](user-guide.md) module will be removed from Customer Insights - Journeys on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md)

## Guidance on specific capabilities

See below for guidance on specific capabilities that are done differently in real-time or are not yet available. Capabilities not listed here are currently not prioritized. We strongly recommend that you do not wait for these capabilities and complete your transition to real-time using alternative approaches.

### Prevent email duplications
- **Details:** Ability to prevent sending duplicated emails to the same email address.
- **Guidance:** Available, see [Preview: Prevent sending emails to duplicated email addresses - Dynamics 365 Customer Insights | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/journeys/email-deduplication#known-issues)

### Custom Channels
Custom channels don't have migration tools and need to be re-implemented in real-time journeys.
