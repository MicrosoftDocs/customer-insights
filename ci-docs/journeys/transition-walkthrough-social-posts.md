# Social posting and LinkedIn Lead Gen

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The [outbound marketing](user-guide.md) module will be removed from Customer Insights - Journeys on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md)

> [!WARNING]
> Social posting and LinkedIn lead generation capabilities have been removed from Customer Insights - Journeys.

## Social posts

The post to social media feature from outbound marketing has no equivalent in real-time journeys. There are no plans to incorporate this feature.

## LinkedIn Lead Gen

LinkedIn Lead Gen capabilities was removed from outbound marketing on December 2, 2024. We're considering adding LinkedIn Lead Gen to real-time journeys in a future release. However, there's currently no planned timeline for the feature.

Customer Insights – Journeys does not receive data from LinkedIn forms. You won't be able to sign up for new LinkedIn accounts or reauthenticate any existing accounts. You can still access existing data and campaigns in LinkedIn continue unaffected.

To develop a custom integration, follow the guide in [LinkedIn Lead Sync Integration with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights – Journeys](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/post/?postid=fb6ed89f-67a1-ef11-8a69-7c1e520b1f9b).
