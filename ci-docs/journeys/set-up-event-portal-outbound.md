# Set up the event website in outbound marketing

The event website provides an online resource where people can read about your event and its speakers, create an account, register for the event, purchase passes, view their session schedule, and more. The following image shows a simplified site map of your event website as your attendees will see it.

![Sitemap for the standard event website.](media/event-portal-sitemap-ill.png "Site map for the standard event website")

The event site is preconfigured to fetch all the relevant graphics and information for each published event from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, and to enable visitors to create a registration account (including username and password), edit their profile, register themselves and others for an event, choose session passes, view their event schedule, and modify or cancel an event registration.

<a name="customize"></a>

## Customize and host the event website

The first time you install Customer Insights - Journeys, the event website is installed onto your Power Apps portals solution and is ready to use right out of the box. The website is built using the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework (which makes it easy to customize) and you can choose to host it anywhere (not just on the Power Apps portals solution). The following table describes the hosting options.

| Feature | Dynamics&nbsp;365<br/>native portal | Angular site hosted by<br/>Dynamics&nbsp;365 portals | Angular site<br>hosted externally |
|--|--|--|--|
|Availability | Discontinued (no longer available) | Installed out-of-the-box; fully customizable | [Download the project, customize it, and deploy it to your own server](developer/event-management-web-application.md) |

Check the **Event URL** field of the event record to find it. | The URL depends on where you host the site. You can store the URL in the event record by selecting the **Custom event URL** check box and then filling in the **Event URL** field.

You can download the Angular project from the Microsoft download center, customize it in your preferred development environment, build the project, and then either overwrite the version on your Power Apps portal, set it up as a new site on your portal, or host it on your own server. The entire final site comprises just two files: a JavaScript file (named `main.js`) and a stylesheet (named `styles.css`).

The first time you install Customer Insights - Journeys, the then-current event website is installed onto your Power Apps portals solution and is ready to use right out of the box. The website won't be updated or overwritten when you update Customer Insights - Journeys, so you can freely customize the copy that's installed on your portal. However, Microsoft will continue to develop the event website and improve it with with each new release of Customer Insights - Journeys, so if you want to take advantage of the latest features, you can always download it, compare it with your own customized site, and add any of the new features that you like.

For more information about how to download the latest version of the event website, customize it, build it, and then deploy it on a Power Apps portal or external website, see [Build and host a custom event website](developer/event-management-web-application.md).

## Publish events, sessions, tracks, and related records to the website

Most of the information shown on the website comes directly from your event models and their various related records, so all you need to do get the website online is make sure that all the information is available in Customer Insights - Journeys and that the event itself, plus its relevant sessions and tracks, are set to be published on the website. The event and all its settings remain editable even after you go live, and any changes you make to a live event, and its related live records, will immediately be reflected on the website too.

Event sessions work similarly to the event itself, and essentially function as sub-events that, taken together, create the overall event schedule. The event website shows a schedule of live sessions that belong to each event. An event can include both live and not-live sessions, but only live sessions belonging to live events are shown on the website.

Event tracks are collections of sessions, usually related by theme or audience. Tracks provide a convenient way for attendees to register for several related sessions at once. Like event sessions, you must publish each track to make it appear on the website for its related event. An event can include both live and not-live tracks, but only the live tracks belonging to live events are shown on the website.

Event, session, and track entities all have a **Publish status** field, which users can use to store information about the readiness of the event, including whether it's ready to publish or live. This value is shown as a drop-down list in the upper-right corner when you are editing an event or session record, but is part of the main form for session tracks.

![The Publish Status menu for events.](media/golive-publish-event.png "The Publish Status menu for events")

The default values for **Publish status** are **Draft**, **Ready to go live**, **In progress**, **Live**, and **Cancelled**. Other than **Live**, all these values are for information only, so you can use them to track your work progress and coordinate with coworkers as needed. The **Live** value works slightly differently depending on which entity you are working with as follows:

- For events and sessions, the **Live** value only appears in the **Publish status** drop-down list while the event or session is actually live. To go live with an event or session, use the **Go live** button on the command bar while the relevant event or session is open. You can stop a live event or session either by selecting **Stop** on the command bar or by changing the **Publish status** to anything other than **Live**.
- When you create a new session using the quick-create form (which you can do while working with the [calendar view](marketing-calendar.md) on the **Agenda** tab for an event), the form includes a **Publish status** drop-down list that does include the **Live** value. In this case, you can set the **Publish status** to **Live** while creating the session to go live right away.
- For session tacks, use the **Publish status** drop-down list both to go live and to stop a live track (the command bar doesn't include **Go live** or **Stop** buttons). Set it to **Live** to publish the track and make it visible publicly on your event website. Set the **Publish status** to any value other than **Live** to hide the track on your event website. For tracks, the **Publish status** drop-down list is located on the **General** tab for the track record rather than at the side of the header (as it is for events and sessions).

The following table summarizes how to publish each publishable entity to the website, and which types of information are publish for each of them. Be especially careful and thorough when entering values for published fields, because they are exposed to the public.

|   **Entity**   |  **How and where it gets published**   |  **Which fields get published** |
|-------|----|-----------|
|     Events     |  Publish each event manually by opening the event record and selecting **Go live** on the command bar.

## Configure website graphics and registration options

The website provides several per-event configuration options that you can set up using the relevant event record, without needing to customize the website code. These include graphics, check-out, and payment options.

### Upload and assign website graphics

The website features a banner image for each event, and also shows speaker photos and sponsor logos.

- You can set the banner image shown for any event by [editing the event record](set-up-event.md), going to the **General** tab and using the **Portal image** setting.

- Speaker images come from each speaker record (not from the related contact record). To upload a speaker image, go to **Events** > **Participants** > **Speakers** and open the relevant speaker record. Then select the existing photo (or generic placeholder) in the heading area of the page to open a dialog where you can upload an image. More information: [Set up an event](set-up-event.md)  
    ![Edit the speaker image.](media/speaker-edit-image.png "Edit the speaker image")

- Sponsor images come from each sponsorship record (not from the related account record), which you can edit by working in the event record where the sponsorship applies (found on the **Agenda** tab, which links to related sponsorship records), or by finding the appropriate sponsorship record under **Events** > **Sponsorship management** > **Sponsorships**. As with speaker images, you can upload an image (such as a logo) to be displayed on the event website by selecting the existing photo (or the generic placeholder) in the heading area of the sponsorship record page.

<a name="registration"></a>

### Set registration options

When a visitor to the website decides to register for your event, they proceed as follows:

1. Open the event website and choose an event.
1. Select the **Register** button.
1. The registration page opens. If you've enabled anonymous registration, then the visitor can enter registration details right away, or they can choose to sign in (or to create an account first). If you've disabled anonymous registration, then they must sign in or create an account before they can register anyone.
    - The registration can allow several people to be registered at once, or you can set it to allow just one attendee to be registered at a time.
    - If your event offers pass-level registration and includes more than one pass, then the form allows a different pass to be selected for each registrant as needed. (Session-level registration isn't available when you use this option.)
    - If your event offers session-level registration, then the form allows the registrant to assemble their own schedule from all available sessions. (Passes and online payment aren't available if you use this option)
    - If you've chosen to enable a CAPTCHA, then the visitor must fill out the CAPTCHA field to continue after entering details about each registrant.
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Beginning in November 2022, the [Captcha](http://www.captcha.net/) service endpoints for event website are changing. If you have origin checks for your event portal requests, the Captcha call origin points will change from `https://client.prod.repmap.microsoft.com/` to `https://*.svc.dynamics.com` (where * varies based on the Events API).
        >
        > You can learn more about the Events API in the [Using the Events API](developer/using-events-api.md) article.
    - One advantage of creating a registration account is that those contacts can sign in again to view their event schedules and to cancel registrations if needed.
    - If you are hosting the event website on a Power Apps portal, then visitors who use the site to create a registration account must do so using an email address that doesn't belong to any contact already in your database.
1. If your event requires payment, a payment gateway opens and the visitor must enter their payment details.
1. When payment confirmation is received (or right away, if no payment is required), contact records are matched or created (as required) and registration records are created and linked to each new or existing contact that was entered into the registration form.
1. When lead generation is activated for an event, a unique lead record is created for every contact that registers. However, if a contact who previously registered for an event registers for the same event again, a new lead record *is not* created.

Here's how to configure each of the options that's described as optional in the previous procedure:

1. Do the following if you want to support online payment for events:
    - Create an account with a third-party payment provider.
    - Customize your event website (or set up the portal) to include a payment page that interacts with your payment provider. More information: [Set up online payment for events](event-payment-gateway.md).
    - Set up at least one [pass for the event](set-up-event.md#event-passes). (Events with no passes assigned will skip the payment page.)
1. Go to **Events** > **Event** > **Events** and then open or create an event.
1. On the **General** tab of the event form, go to the **Key information** section. If you want to generate a lead for each contact that gets registered for this event, set **Create leads for event registrations** to **Yes**. <!-- What happens if this is "no"? -->
1. Scroll down to the **Website** section and make the following settings:
    - **Enable CAPTCHA**: Set to **Yes** to include a CAPTCHA field on the registration page. Set to **No** to hide it. This setting works for both portal hosted and externally hosted event websites.
    - **Portal payment gateway**:  If you are hosting the event website on a Power Apps portal, set this to the name of the portal page that you set up to implement a payment gateway. A default or simulated payment page may be used if you leave this setting blank (to disable payment, either customize the site to remove the feature, or don't create any passes for your free events). This setting has no effect if you are hosting your event website externally.
    - **Enable multi-attendee registration**: Set this to **Yes** to allow users of the event website to register several attendees at once. Set to **No** to allow just one attendee per registration.
    - **Allow anonymous registrations**: If you are hosting the event website on a Power Apps portal, set this to **No** to require all visitors to create an event-website account before they can register themselves or others for an event; set to **Yes** to allow visitors to register without creating an event-website account. This setting has no effect if you are hosting your event website externally; see [Build and host a custom event website](developer/event-management-web-application.md) for details about how to enable registration accounts on externally hosted sites.
1. Go to the **Agenda** tab and set the **Allow registrants to create their own agenda** option to **Yes** if you want to use session-level registration, or to **No** to use pass-level registration (with optional online payment).
1. Save your settings.

## Simulate payment for demo purposes

If you'd like to demo the event website checkout process, but haven't yet set up the integration with a third-party payment provider, then you can enable simulated payment as described in [Event administration](events-settings.md#event-admin).

> [!WARNING]
> You must only enable simulated payment when presenting a demo of the event website. You must always disable it again before going to production because the simulated feature can introduce a security vulnerability if enabled in a production environment.

<a name="generate-leads"></a>

## Generate and match contacts and leads from event registrations

When a new event registration is received, Customer Insights - Journeys looks to see if a matching contact record already exists. If a match is found, then a new event registration is created and linked to that contact. If no match is found, a new contact record is created and linked to the new registration record. 

Your admin can choose to match incoming registrations by email alone; first name and last name; or email, first name, and last name. For details about how to choose your matching strategy, see [Event administration](events-settings.md#event-admin).

If you choose to enable lead generation for events, then a new lead will also be generated for each registration and linked to the appropriate contact. However, if a contact who previously registered an event registers for the same event again, a new lead record *is not* created. To control whether to generate new leads for any event, open the event record and set the **Create leads for event registrations** option to **Yes** or **No**.

<a name="open-site"></a>

## Open the event website

To find the URL for your sample event website and open it:

1. Open the relevant [event record](set-up-event.md).
1. Make sure the **Publish status** is set to **Live**.
1. Open the **General** tab and find the **Key information** section.
1. The **Event URL** field here shows the address of the website for this event. This URL is provided automatically if you're using the event website that was installed together with Customer Insights - Journeys, but if you're hosting the site [somewhere else](#customize), you (or another user) must mark the **Custom event URL** check box and specify this value as required. Select the globe button at the edge of this field to open the URL.

The URL for any specific event takes the following form:

`https://<domainAndPath>/?event=<ReadableEventID>`

Where:

- _&lt;domainAndPath&gt;_ is the location where you installed the event website on your portal or external site.
- _&lt;ReadableEventID&gt;_ is a readable ID that was generated the first time you saved the event record (based on the event name). To find this value, open the relevant event record, go to the **General** tab, scroll to the **Website** section, where you'll find the **Readable event ID**. If you leave off this ID then the event website opens to a list of available events.
