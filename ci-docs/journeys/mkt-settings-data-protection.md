# Data protections in outbound marketing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](user-guide.md), which is gradually being removed from Customer Insights - Journeys.** To avoid interruptions, stop using outbound marketing and transition to real-time journeys. Learn more: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md).

Use the **Settings** > **Email marketing** > **Data protections** page to enable data privacy features of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys. For more information, including how to use the settings here, see [Data protection and privacy](privacy.md).
