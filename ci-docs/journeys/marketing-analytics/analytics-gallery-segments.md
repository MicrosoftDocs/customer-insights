## Leaderboard and segmentation usage report

The leaderboard report helps you identify the most-used segments and the journeys that use the most segments.

## Orphaned segmentation report

The orphaned segment report identifies segments that aren't used anywhere. We recommend that you regularly clean up your unused segments to prevent clutter and reserve your processing resources for segments that you actually use.
