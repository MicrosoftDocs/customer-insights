# Understanding the flow of a journey

This page provides an overview of the flow of a journey, from start to finish, in Customer Insights - Journeys.

## Journey start

The journey start configuration lets you define how customers can start the journey. There are two types of journeys you can create: [Trigger-based journeys](journey-start.md#trigger-based-journey) and [Segment-based journeys](journey-start.md#segment-based-journey). For more information, see [Start a journey](journey-start.md).

## Journey end

By default, customers end the journey when they complete all the steps. You can set additional ways for customers to exit the journey by using triggers or segments such as when an event occurs. For more information, see [End a journey](journey-end.md).
