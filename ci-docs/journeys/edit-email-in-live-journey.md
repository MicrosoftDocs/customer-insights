# Edit email components in a live journey

The email editor in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights â€“ Journeys allows you to create and design engaging email messages for your customers. You can use various components such as text, images, buttons, links, and dynamic content to customize your email layout and content.

Once you activate a customer journey, the email messages that are part of it are sent to the recipients according to the schedule and conditions that you set. However, you may need to make changes to your email messages after the journey is live, for example, to correct a typo, update an offer, or add a new link.
