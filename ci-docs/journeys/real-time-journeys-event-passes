# Set up event passes 
Event passes act as tickets that grant attendees access to your event and its sessions or tracks. Passes are optional, but they’re essential if you want to manage paid access, session-level permissions, or special categories of registrations (e.g., VIP, sponsors). This feature is in public preview. To enable the feature please navigate to Settings > feature switches and under Event management section, enable the toggle "Enable payments in Real-time Journeys".



## What are event passes?

Passes can be sold or given away to control access and capacity limits to your event and its sessions. Each pass type can:
- Apply to a specific event.
- Include name, pricing, description and allocation limits.
- Control access to specific sessions.

For each assigned pass, Customer Insights – Journeys generates an attendee pass with unique ID and a unique QR code for check-in and attendance tracking. 

## How to set up event passes
Go to the event record → Passes tab. Use the quick create form to add a new pass and define:
- Name 
- 

Event where the pass applies.
Category (attendee, speaker, etc.).
Price (if paid).
Allocation (number of passes available).




Add Sessions

After creating a pass, open it and use the Eligible sessions tab.
Add sessions individually or by track.

Note: Adding a track copies its current sessions into the pass. Future track changes won’t update the pass automatically.




Publish Passes

Set Passes Allocated to a positive number to make it visible on the event website.
If allocation = 0, the pass remains hidden (useful for VIP or draft passes).
