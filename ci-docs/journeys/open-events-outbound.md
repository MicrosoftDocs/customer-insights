# Open the event management work area in outbound marketing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This article only applies to [outbound marketing](user-guide.md), which will be removed from the product on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md)

The event management features of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys are collected into their own work area to make it easy to find all the relevant entities and settings while you are focusing on events.

To find the event management work area:

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to Dynamics 365 as a user with [event-management privileges](admin-users-licenses-roles.md). Then use the app-selector menu to open the **Customer Insights - Journeys** app.

1. Expand the work-area area menu at the bottom of the side navigator and select **Events**.

1. You are now in the Events work area, and can navigate between event-related entities using the side navigator, just as with the core **Customer Insights - Journeys** work area.

1. If you have outbound and Customer Insights - Journeys installed, there is a drop-down menu to the right of the **New Event** button where you can create an event inside Customer Insights - Journeys. When outbound and Customer Insights - Journeys are installed, you’ll see outbound and Customer Insights - Journeys events in the same events list.
