# Override field-level security attributes

This article explains how field-level security (FLS)-protected attributes affect personalization, journey branching, real-time segmentation, and how to override FLS attributes.

FLS is a platform feature that allows you to restrict access to certain fields on Dataverse entities such as contact, account, or lead. For example, you can use FLS to protect sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers or salaries, from unauthorized users. FLS is configured by creating field security profiles and adding users or teams to them.

By default, Customer Insights - Journeys doesn't let you use FLS-protected attributes in these scenarios:

- Content personalization: You can't define dynamic text or conditions that use FLS-protected attributes.
- Journey personalization and branching: You can't use FLS-protected attributes in conditions for journey branching or personalization.
- Real-time segmentation: You can't use FLS-protected attributes in filters or expressions for real-time segments.

Using [Dataverse table data](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/entity-overview) with Customer Insights – Journeys, you can create and send personalized messages to your customers and branch journeys to automate sending personalized messages to large real-time audience segments. However, this also increases the risk of exposing sensitive data if everyone in your team can access and use FLS-protected fields in the messages. By default, to prevent privacy issues, Customer Insights – Journeys doesn't let everyone use FLS-protected fields in the messages.

## Prerequisites for overriding FLS

You can override the FLS limitation and use FLS-protected attributes in personalization, journey branching, or real-time segmentation using feature switches in the **Settings** > **Feature switches** area. However, before changing the feature switches, you must carefully consider security and privacy issues and obtain the appropriate approvals. Before overriding FLS:

1. Identify all application and system users who need access to FLS-protected attributes and add them to the respective FLS profiles. To learn about the details of security roles, see [Manage user accounts, user licenses, and security roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/journeys/admin-users-licenses-roles). Next, add the service users mentioned in [Customer Insights - Journeys service users](admin-users-licenses-roles.md#form-and-field-level-security) to the appropriate FLS profiles.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you skip this step, FLS-protected fields are shown as "null" during internal system evaluations, which can cause errors that are hard to diagnose.
   1. Make sure that only FLS-enabled users can publish journeys. This step helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information by unauthorized users.
e1. Review how FLS works and the changes you make or plan to make with the people responsible for security and privacy in your company. Get their approval on the following statement:

    *After the FLS override is in place, all journeys can use the FLS-protected attributes even if they're published by users who aren't in the FLS profiles. This is because Customer Insights - Journeys runs in the application user context, not in the context of the publishing user.*
 in the context of the publishing user.*

If you don't follow these steps, you can encounter serious issues, such as:

- Journeys or personalization not working as expected. For example, empty emails can be sent, branching can behave incorrectly, or Customer Insights - Journeys can crash.
- You can violate your data privacy and compliance policies by exposing FLS-protected data to unauthorized users.

## Set the feature switches to override FLS

After you finish the prerequisites and accept the risks of overriding FLS, enable the following feature switches on the **Settings** > **Feature switches** page:
- To override FLS in journeys and personalization, enable the “Use protected fields in personalization” feature switch in the “Personalization” group. You need to acknowledge the risks, and your user ID is recorded and displayed for audit purposes.
- To override FLS in segmentation, enable the "Use protected fields in segments" feature switch in the "Segmentation" group. Learn more in [Add protected fields in segment criteria](protected-fields.md).
