# Sync data tables into the segment builder

The Customer Insights - Journeys segment builder allows you to sync data tables without relying on the help of administrators. This saves you time when setting up segments, letting you directly add data tables to Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys without using the Dynamics 365 admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> Real-time marketing doesn't support adding virtual tables. Trying to add these tables using the "+Add table" button won't reveal the tables in the table list. This is because virtual tables aren't synced on the backend.

**Example**: You want to create a segment using attributes from the Fax table in Dataverse, but you notice that Fax isnâ€™t available in your related data tables.

To add the Fax table directly from the Customer Insights - Journeys app, go to the Customer Insights - Journeys segment builder and create or select a segment. Then, in the **Elements** side pane, select **+Add table** next to **Related tables**. Search for the Fax table, select the check box next to it, then select **Next** to add the table to the segment builder.

After you add the new table, you can use the attributes from Fax immediately in your segment creation.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours for a data table to be synchronized into the system. At this time, the segment member size estimate and preview features are not available. You cannot view the segment membership until the table is synchronized into the system.
