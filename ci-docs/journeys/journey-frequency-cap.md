# Use frequency capping in your journey to limit the number of messages sent

Frequency caps let you limit how many messages a customer receives through a specific channel within a set time period. This feature prevents customers, especially those involved in multiple campaigns or journeys, from being overwhelmed by too many messages in a short span.

## Adjust journey frequency cap settings

The [frequency cap setting](real-time-marketing-frequency-cap.md) is on by default for all journeys. After you set frequency cap limits in the global settings, messages are capped. If you have editing rights for a journey, you can bypass the cap for a specific journey. To bypass the frequency cap:

1. Go to **Journeys**.
1. Select a journey to edit. You can only edit draft journeys. To bypass the frequency cap for a live journey, republish it with the new setting.
1. Under **Other settings**, find **Frequency cap**. Exclude the journey from the frequency cap here.
