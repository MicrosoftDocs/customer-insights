|------------------|-----------------|

<!---
#### General availability

- **Accelerate journey creation using journey templates**
	- Increase your productivity by using journey templates to kickstart building your customer journeys. Save time using a template from common customer journey scenarios, make final updates with your chosen content and any slight adjustments to the flows, and publish.
	- [Release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2024wave2/customer-insights/dynamics365-customer-insights-journeys/marketers-accelerate-journey-creation-using-journey-templates)
	- [Docs](real-time-marketing-journey-templates.md)-->

#### Public preview
	
- **Wait on segment membership to trigger the next step in a journey** 
	- Gain even more control over your customers' experience by waiting for them to become a member of a segment before continuing to the next steps in a journey. This added capability lets you personalize each customer's experience by choosing the correct path and actions relevant to individual customers based on whether they're in a segment. This capability adds to existing if/then capabilities that let you wait for a customer to open an email, click a link, or wait for another trigger to be activated before moving on to the next step in the journey. For example, let's say you use your journey to send credit card activation emails and you want to wait for the customer to activate their card before sending a welcome email. If the customer doesn’t activate their credit card within a few days, you want to send another reminder email. If you have a segment that includes all customers who have activated credit cards, you can use that segment as the condition for the if/then branch to wait for each customer to activate their credit card and send them the right communications.

- **Allow individuals to reenter a one-time, dynamic segment journey** 
	- Audience members who move between stages of the customer lifecycle may need to repeat a lifecycle-specific state of the journey. For example, if a customer repeats a buying journey for a different product, they may reenter the dynamic segment conditions as they reenter the purchase funnel. As such, they should be allowed to reenter a journey for that dynamic segment when they come back into it.

- **Create event portals with event and registration details using Power Pages** 
	- Events are a pivotal element of your business strategy, aiding in customer acquisition and engagement. A centralized location is essential for your clients to discover and learn about events that you're organizing. The new event portal allows for the swift creation of a comprehensive hub where customers can access event details, session specifics, and speaker schedules and conveniently register using the event registration form. The portal can be seamlessly deployed through Power Pages, where it can be tailored to align with your brand identity using Power Pages Studio.

- **Create an event portal on your own website** 
	- Events are a pivotal element of your business strategy, aiding in customer acquisition and engagement. A centralized location is essential for your clients to discover and learn about events you are organizing. The new events API offers a programmatic method to access data of events, sessions, session tracks, passes, speakers, and sponsorships. Additionally, it allows you to register for events and sessions.

	- [Docs](../journeys/developer/using-rtm-events-api.md)

#### Monthly enhancements

- **Create custom form templates** 
	- Creating marketing and event registration forms is now easier, as you can leverage a custom template. The custom template can reflect styling adjustments to align with your style guide. You can also set the audience configuration and adjust the consent to meet your requirements.
