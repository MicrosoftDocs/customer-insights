# Tailor follow-up strategies by leveraging multiple customer actions at once (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The multi-interaction branching feature in Customer Insights - Journeys enables marketers to configure journey branches based on diverse customers' responses from a single decision node in a journey. Whether it's an email *bounced*, *blocked*, or a link *selected*, multi-interaction branching allows for more nuanced and intelligent journey design. Marketers can better personalize customer experiences by evaluating several interaction outcomes at once through a single branching condition in a journey.

## What are marketing interactions? 

The core of this feature is the use of marketing interaction triggers that are provided in the system. Marketing interactions represent the signals generated by customer engagement across various outbound channels, such as email, SMS, push notifications, and voice calls. These signals, such as email opened, text message reply received, or push notification clicked, offer marketers insight into how a customer is engaging with communication. These interactions aide quick decision-making, enabling marketing teams to respond dynamically based on behavior and intent, and help optimize the customer journey accordingly. 

## Benefits of multi-interaction branching 

This capability significantly enhances the flexibility and sophistication of journey design by allowing a single branching node to evaluate and route customers based on multiple interaction conditions. This reduces design complexity and opens new opportunities for contextual messaging strategies tailored to real customer behavior. 

Key benefits include: 

* **Greater personalization**: More sophisticated decision-making at key moments of interaction. 
* **Simplified journey design**: Reduces the need for multiple branching nodes. 
* **Improved engagement and deliverability**: Improves follow-up messaging based on specific interaction outcomes. 

## Example use cases â€“ Contoso Coffee 

Contoso Coffee, a premium coffee chain, leverages multi-interaction branching to optimize how customers move through their journeys based on real-time engagement across multiple channels. For example, in an email campaign promoting a new espresso subscription, Contoso configures a journey that reacts differently depending on how customers engage. If the email is successfully delivered and opened, the customer receives a follow-up email with a personalized discount. If the email is delivered but not opened within 24 hours, a push notification is triggered to re-engage interest. If the email bounces, the customer is flagged for data cleansing. If blocked, the customer is added to a suppression list for compliance review. 

In another scenario, Contoso Coffee initiates an SMS-based feedback journey after a customer visit. If the customer replies to the text message, a "Thank You" message and next-visit coupon are sent. If the customer selects the feedback link but doesn't complete the survey, a reminder email is issued. For customers who don't engage, a push notification is sent 48 hours later to encourage participation. 

When choosing to launch mobile push notifications for time-sensitive promotions (such as a weekend buy-one-get-one-free offer), Contoso Coffee uses branching to drive optimal engagement. If a customer opens the notification and selects the offer link, they're directed to a confirmation page and logged as claimed the offer. If the notification is only opened, a banner is displayed in-app during the next session. Customers who take no action receive a follow-up SMS containing the same promotional details. 

Contoso also runs reactivation campaigns via automated voice calls. If the call is attempted and answered, the customer hears a personalized message and is given the option to speak with support. If the call isn't attempted due to technical issues, the contact is placed in a manual call queue. In cases where the call is blocked, the customer is excluded from future voice campaigns and flagged for channel preference updates. 

These use cases illustrate how Contoso Coffee uses multi-interaction branching to deliver personalized, responsive customer experiences across multiple touchpoints. This drives higher engagement, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
