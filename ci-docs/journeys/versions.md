# Use the versions page to check and update current version

The versions page shows you the current version of the solutions on your environment and the status of those solutions relative to what's been released.

If there are new solution updates available, select **Manage+Update** to launch the installation management page. Find the environment you'd like to update and select **Check Versions** and then choose **Update**.

Note: You may see an additional area with version details for Outbound marketing module which reached its end of life as of Jun 30, 2025. You can ignore this information as it is temporary and will be removed in a future release.
