# Create a static snapshot of a segment

Static lists are an important part of audience management. They let you:

1. Create point-in-time campaigns for customer segments that meet criteria at the time of segment creation.
1. Manage your customer list manually with a selective list that doesn't follow any logical conditions.
1. Create a seed list to test your customer journeys.

The Customer Insights - Journeys static segment experience helps you capture the audience that matters with simplicity, flexibility, and effectiveness.

## How to create a static snapshot of your segment

**Example**: Let’s say you have a list of all contacts who’ve checked into the event, “Contoso Furniture Design Workshop.”

Using the [attribute logic builder](real-time-marketing-build-segments.md), you build your segment as usual. You then decide that you want to create a static snapshot to capture only the contacts who’ve checked into the event at the time you’re making the segment. To create a static snapshot of the segment, go to **Settings**, and set the segment refresh rate to **Static snapshot**.
