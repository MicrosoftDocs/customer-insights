# Open the Power Apps customization window

Most types of customizations require you to work in the **Power Apps** customization window. To get there:

1. Open the **Settings** menu ![The Settings menu icon.](media/settings-icon.png "The Settings menu icon") at the top of the page and select **Advanced settings**. The advanced-settings area then opens in a new browser tab. Note that this area uses a horizontal navigator at the top of the page instead of a side navigator.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Customization** > **Customizations** and then choose **Customize the System** from the **Customization** page.

1. A **Power Apps** customization pop-up window opens. Use the left panel to navigate and select the item you want to customize. Then use the area on the right to make your settings.
