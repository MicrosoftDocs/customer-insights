# Get answers to questions about capabilities from Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-banner](./includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data can help you achieve your goals by answering your questions about the application and its features. You ask questions in natural language about capabilities and Copilot answers it, using the [official documentation](index.yml), [troubleshooting guides](/troubleshoot/dynamics-365/customer-insights/welcome-customer-insights), and blogs from the Microsoft team on how to set up Customer Insights - Data. These sources are organized as a Bing Search index, which is the reason for Copilot showing the disclaimer about Bing Search being used for certain capabilities. To use this capability an admin user needs to provide consent through the [consent experience](copilot-global-consent.md).

Copilot generates responses in accordance with [Microsoft Responsible AI Standards](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai). For more information, see [FAQ for docs-based Q&A capability](faqs-docs-qna.md).

Administrators in Customer Insights - Data can disable all Copilot functionality through the [consent experience](copilot-global-consent.md). Whether Copilot is available in an environment depends on its regions and supported languages.

This Copilot pane is available on all pages of Customer Insights - Data except:

- When create or edit a segment, [Copilot assists you with segment creation](segments-copilot.md) instead.

While you use Copilot, the previous messages remain in the side pane. You can revisit them by scrolling and reference previous answers when asking a follow-up question.

This conversation history is kept temporarily until you close the Customer Insights - Data app.
