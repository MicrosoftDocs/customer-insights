## Getting started with Customer Insights - Data

This section contains cards that help you walk through the process of setting up your environment.

1. The **Add data sources** card assists you with your data import. Customer Insights - Data supports [several options to bring in data about your customers](data-sources.md). Select **Add data sources** to get started.
1. Once the initial data import successfully completes, you can use the **Unify data** card to harmonize the data and [create unified customer profiles](data-unification.md) from disparate sources. 
1. With unified customer profiles in place, it's time to review the **Analyze data** options and get more insights. Give it a try to create [business measures](measures.md) to track KPIs, [define segments](segments.md) to reach specific audiences, or [configure predictions](predictions.md) with the help of AI.
1. Now that your customer data is imported, unified, and neatly structured, you use our [various export destinations](export-destinations.md) to take action on the data. Select **Add connections** to connect your favorite services. For example, export the data to Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys to create marketing campaigns and build customer journeys.

## Your customer insights section

- **Segments** shows groups of customers based on demographic, behavioral, or transactional attributes that you defined. [Creating segments](segments.md) helps you to group your customer base and better target your business activities.

- **Business measures** shows tiles with [key performance indicators (KPIs)](measures.md) that you defined. For example, average likelihood of a customer to churn or the average online spend per customer.

- **Enrichments** lists results of the enrichment runs that completed recently. [Enrichments](enrichment-manage.md) add information about your customer base. For example, by understanding the interests and brands that they have affinity for.
