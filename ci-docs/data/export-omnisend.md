# Export segments to Omnisend (preview)

Export segments of unified customer profiles to Omnisend and use them for marketing activities.

## Prerequisites

- An [Omnisend account](https://www.omnisend.com/) and corresponding administrator credentials.
- An [Omnisend API key](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1061890-generating-api-key).
- [Configured segments](segments.md).
- Unified customer profiles in the exported segments contain a field representing an email address.

## Known limitations

- Up to 1 million customer profiles per export to Omnisend, which can take up to four hours to complete. The number of customer profiles that you can export to Omnisend depends on your contract with Omnisend.
