# Set up connections for storage accounts behind firewalls

If you have Azure Data Lake Storage accounts protected by firewalls, use [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) to connect to Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data. Azure Private Link lets Customer Insights - Data connect to your Azure storage over a private endpoint in your virtual network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The announced transition from Private Links to managed identities for Azure resources has been paused while we look at options to reduce the impact. The original due date of November 30, 2024 no longer applies. Updated guidance will be provided early next year. For questions, contact CIDManagedIdentity@Microsoft.com.
> 
> If your instance doesn't already use private links, your instance must be updated first to support private links. Contact [Support](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/support) to get your instance updated.

There are three scenarios where Customer Insights - Data can be configured to connect to firewall-protected Azure storage containers:

- When creating a new Customer Insights - Data environment for which you would like to [Use your own Azure Data Lake Storage account](own-data-lake-storage.md) that is protected by your virtual network.
- When creating a [data source](data-sources.md) for which the data is stored in your protected Azure Data Lake Storage account.
- Directly from the **Settings** > **Permissions** > **Private Links** page in Customer Insights - Data.

## Prerequisites

- Minimum role requirement to set up a Private Link connection:
  - Customer Insights - Data: Administrator
  - Azure built-in role: [Storage Account Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor)
  - Permissions for custom Azure role: [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read and Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/PrivateEndpointConnectionsApproval/action](/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftstorage)

## Set up a Private Link when creating a Customer Insights - Data environment

When creating a [Customer Insights - Data environment](create-environment.md) that connects to your virtual network protected storage:

1. Select **Enable Azure Private Link**.

1. Select **Create Private Link** to initiate the creation process.

1. [Approve the Private Link](#approve-your-private-link-in-the-azure-portal) in the Azure portal.

1. Once all links are approved, select **Validate Private Link**. Upon successful validation, you can continue configuring your new environment.

## Set up a Private Link when creating a data source

When creating an [Azure Data Lake Storage data source](connect-common-data-model.md) that needs to connect to a storage protected by a virtual network, follow the same steps as described under [Setting up a private link when creating a Customer Insights - Data environment](#set-up-a-private-link-when-creating-a-customer-insights---data-environment).

## Set up a Private Link directly from the Private Links page in Customer Insights - Data

1. In Customer Insights - Data, go to **Settings** > **Permissions** and select the **Private Links** tab.

1. Select **Add Private Link**.

   The **Add Private Link** pane lists storage accounts in your tenant that you can see.

1. Select the subscription, resource group, and storage account.

1. Review the [data privacy and compliance](connections.md#data-privacy-and-compliance) and select **I agree**.

1. Select **Save**.

## Approve your Private Link in the Azure portal

After configuring the Private Link between Customer Insights - Data and your virtual network protected storage, four Private Links show on the **Private Links** tab in Customer Insights - Data with a status of **Pending**.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Data Lake Storage account, and select **Networking** > **Private endpoints connections** to see the four new Private Links.

1. Select **Yes** to approve them.

   > [!TIP]
   > For easy identification, consider adding a description when approving the Private Links.

## Delete an Azure Private link

1. In Customer Insights - Data, go to **Settings** > **Permissions** and select the **Private Links** tab.

1. Select the storage account name for which you would like to delete the Private Links.

1. Select **Delete**.
