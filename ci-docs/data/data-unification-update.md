# Update unification settings

To review or change any unification settings once a unified profile has been created, perform the following steps.

1. Go to **Data** > **Unify**.

   The **Unify** page displays the number of unified customer profiles and tiles for each of the unification steps.

   :::image type="content" source="media/m3_unified.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data Unify page after data is unified." lightbox="media/m3_unified.png":::

1. Choose what you want to update:
   - [Customer data](#edit-customer-data) to add columns or tables or change column types. To remove a column, see [Remove a unified field](#remove-a-unified-field). To remove a table, see [Remove a unified table](#remove-a-unified-table).
   - [Deduplication rules](#manage-deduplication-rules) to manage deduplication rules or merge preferences.
   - [Matching rules](#manage-match-rules) to update matching rules across two or more tables.
   - [Unified data view](#manage-unified-fields) to combine or exclude fields. You can also group related profiles into clusters.

   > [!TIP]
   > The **Matching rules** tile displays only if multiple tables were selected.

1. After making your changes, choose your next option:

   - [Run matching conditions only](#run-matching-conditions) to quickly evaluate the quality of your deduplication and match rules without updating the unified profile. The **Run matching conditions only** option doesn't display for a single table.
   - [Unify customer profiles](#run-updates-to-the-unified-profile) to run deduplication and match rules and update the unified profile table without impacting dependencies (such as enrichments, segments, or measures). Dependent processes aren't run, but will be refreshed as [defined in the refresh schedule](schedule-refresh.md).
   - [Unify customer profiles and dependencies](#run-updates-to-the-unified-profile) to run deduplication and match rules, update the unified profile table, and update all dependencies (such as enrichments, segments, or measures). All processes are rerun automatically.

## Edit customer data

1. Select **Edit** on the **Customer data** tile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/m3_source_edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Customer data page showing number of primary keys, mapped and unmapped fields":::

   The number of mapped and unmapped fields display.

1. To add other columns or tables, select **Select tables and columns**.

1. Optionally, you can change the primary key for a table or the column types. For more information, see [Describe customer data](data-unification-map-tables.md).

1. Select **Next** to make changes to deduplication rules, or select **Save and close** and return to [Update unification settings](#update-unification-settings).

### Remove a unified field

To remove a field that has been unified, the field must be removed from any dependencies such as segments, measures, enrichments, or relationships.

1. Once all dependencies for the field have been removed, go to **Data** > **Unify**.

1. Select **Edit** on the **Unified data view** tile.

1. Select all occurrences of the field and then select **Exclude**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/m3_remove_attribute1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Unified fields page showing selected fields and Exclude button":::

1. Select **Done** to confirm and then select **Save and close**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you see the message "Couldn't save unify. The specified resource cannot be modified or deleted due to downstream dependencies", then the field is still used in a downstream dependency.

1. If the field is used in a rule for deduplication rules or matching rules, perform the following steps. Otherwise, go to the next step.
   1. Select **Edit** on the **Deduplication rules** tile.
   1. Remove the field from all rules it's used in, if any, and then select **Next**.
   1. On the **Matching rules** page, remove the field from all rules it's used in, if any, and then select **Save and close**.
   1. Select **Unify** > **Unify customer profiles and dependencies**. Wait for unification to complete before going to the next step.

1. Select **Edit** on the **Customer data** tile.

1. Select **Select tables and columns** and clear the checkbox next to each occurrence of the field.

   :::image type="content" source="media/m3_remove_attribute2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Select tables and columns dialog box showing cleared checkboxes":::

1. Select **Save and close**.

1. Select **Unify** > **Unify customer profiles and dependencies** to update the unified profile.

1. Select **Done** to confirm and then select **Save and close**.

   > [!TIP]
