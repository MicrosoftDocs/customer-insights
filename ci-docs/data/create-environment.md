# Create a new environment

After [your organization purchased a license for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](paid-license.md), the administrator of the Microsoft 365 tenant receives an email that invites them to create an environment and [add users from their organization as administrators](permissions.md). These administrators can then manage users and Customer Insights environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In most cases, installing Customer Insights - Data should be done through [Power Platform admin center](../journeys/setup.md).

Use the environments creation experience in Customer Insights - Data for the following scenarios:

- Use your [own Azure Data Lake Storage Account](own-data-lake-storage.md)
- [Enable data sharing](own-data-lake-storage.md#enable-data-sharing-with-dataverse-from-your-own-azure-data-lake-storage-preview) between your own Data Lake Storage Account and Microsoft Dataverse
- [Create a copy of an existing environment configuration (preview)](manage-environments.md#copy-the-environment-configuration-preview)

## Prerequisites

- [Administrator permissions](user-roles.md#admin) in Customer Insights - Data.

To install Customer Insights - Data on an existing Dataverse environment:

- A user [role that allows the creation of Dataverse environments](/power-platform/admin/create-environment).
- You checked that the Dataverse environment is associated to certain security groups and you're added to those security groups.
- A Dataverse license is assigned to you to get Read-Write access mode. Unlicensed administrators get Administrative access mode only.
- Customer Insights - Data isn't already installed. [Learn how to delete an existing environment](manage-environments.md#delete-an-existing-environment).

To create a new Dataverse environment when installing Customer Insights - Data:

- You have the [required license and role in Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#who-can-create-environments).
- Your Power Platform admin didn't [disable the creation of Dataverse environments](/power-platform/admin/control-environment-creation) for everyone except admins.

## Create an environment in Customer Insights - Data

We recommend to [use the consolidated environment manager for Customer Insights](../journeys/setup.md) to create new environment by default.

1. Open the environment picker and select **+ New**.

1. Follow the guided experience outlined in the following sections and provide all required information for a new environment.

### Step 1: Provide basic information

1. Choose whether you want to create an environment from scratch or copy data from another environment. [Copying data from another environment (preview)](manage-environments.md#copy-the-environment-configuration-preview) requires extra steps.

1. Provide the following details:

   - **Name**: Name for this environment. This field is already filled in if you copied an existing environment, but you can change it.
   - **Type**: Type of environment: production or sandbox.
     - Select **Sandbox** for a development and testing environment. Sandbox environments don't support scheduled refreshes.
     - Select **Production** for your production environment or for any environment that you want to mirror your production environment. Production environments provide the maximum scale and performance.
   - **Region**: Region into which the service is deployed and hosted. To [use your own Azure Data Lake Storage account](own-data-lake-storage.md) install on an existing Microsoft Dataverse organization, all environments must be in the same region.

1. Select **Next**.

### Step 2: Configure data storage

1. Choose where to store the data:

   - **Customer Insights storage**: Data storage is managed automatically. It's the default option and unless there are specific requirements to store data in your own storage account, we recommend using this option.
   - **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Your own Azure Data Lake Storage account to store the data so you have full control where the data is stored. Follow the steps in [Use your own Azure Data Lake Storage account](own-data-lake-storage.md).

1. Select **Next**.

### Step 3: Choose Dataverse environment

Select an existing Dataverse environment that doesn't already have a Customer Insights - Data environment installed on it. [Learn more about the required permissions](#prerequisites).

If you chose to use your own Azure Data Lake storage in the previous step, you can [enable data sharing with Dataverse](own-data-lake-storage.md#enable-data-sharing-with-dataverse-from-your-own-azure-data-lake-storage-preview). You can use it with business applications based on Dataverse or model-driven applications in Power Apps.

:::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-provisioning.png" alt-text="data sharing with Microsoft Dataverse autoenabled for new environments.":::

1. Choose an existing Dataverse environment from the drop-down that you want to install Customer Insights - Data. To create a new environment, go to the Power Platform admin center and [create it](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database). Then, refresh the list of environments and select the newly created environment.

1. If you're using your own Data Lake Storage account:
   1. Select **Enable data sharing** with Dataverse.
   1. Enter the **Permissions identifier**. To get the permission identifier, [enable data sharing with Dataverse from your own Azure Data Lake Storage](own-data-lake-storage.md#enable-data-sharing-with-dataverse-from-your-own-azure-data-lake-storage-preview).

1. Select **Next**.

### Step 4: Finalize the settings

Review the specified settings. When everything looks complete, select **Create** to set up the environment.

To change some of the settings later, see [Manage environments](manage-environments.md).

## Work with your new environment

Review the following articles to help you get started:

- [Add more users and assign permissions](permissions.md).
- [Ingest several of your data sources](data-sources.md) and run them through the [data unification process](data-unification.md) to get [unified customer profiles](customer-profiles.md).
- [Enrich the unified customer profiles](enrichment-manage.md) or [run predictive models](predictions.md).
- [Create segments](segments.md) to group customers and [measures](measures.md) to review KPIs.
- [Set up connections](connections.md) and [exports](export-manage.md) to process subsets of your data in other applications.
