# Assign user permissions

Access to Customer Insights - Data is restricted to users in your organization that an admin adds to the application. An admin can add, edit, or remove users. A user can be a single user, group, or application. [User roles](user-roles.md) determine what the user can access within Customer Insights - Data.

## Add users

1. Go to **Settings** > **Permissions** and select the **Users** tab.

1. Select **Add users** to open the **Add/Edit permissions** pane.

1. Use the **Search** field to find the user or group you want to add. Select a **Role** to assign to that user or group.

1. Select **Save**. The current environment is automatically shared with the user or members of the group. Users can access the app and work according to their specified role.

## View current permissions

Go to **Settings** > **Permissions** and select the **Users** tab to view the list of active users and their role assignments. You can sort the list of users by any column or use the search box to find a particular user.

## Manage current users

Go to **Settings** > **Permissions** and select the **Users** tab. You can sort the list of users by any column or use the search box to find the user you want to manage.

Select a user to view available actions.

- **Edit** to edit the user's role in Customer Insights - Data. Select **Save** to confirm the change.
- **Remove** to revoke the user's access. Select **Delete** to confirm the deletion.

It can take up to 15 minutes to fully propagate the changes to permissions. To see changes reflected in the user interface, users should refresh the browser window that runs the application.
