# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Customer Insights trial

Customer Insights offers a free 30-day trial of two applications: Customer Insights - Data and Customer Insights - Journeys. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the apps' key features. The trial allows you to test the apps with sample data and even try out your own customer data.

**To sign up for the trial**:

1. Go to the [trial overview page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/) and select **Try Customer Insights for free**.
1. Follow the onscreen guidance to enter the [email associated with your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/what-is-a-microsoft-account-4a7c48e9-ff5a-e9c6-5a5c-1a57d66c3bfa) and your contact information.
1. Make selections and choose your focus until you get to the start page for your selected capability.

The trial takes a few moments to load, and then you can start using the app. You'll see an environment with sample data to try out the product and its features. Select the button in the message bar at the top of the screen to set up the trial with your own data.
