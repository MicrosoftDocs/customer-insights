*The Marketing Contributor role is only available in [business unit enabled environments](business-units-data-separation.md). All actions and views for the Marketing Contributor are limited to the business unit(s) they have access to.

- Search and filter customer profiles using the **Customers** page. Fields must be searchable.
- View and explore the **Enrichment** page.
- Explore and export tables using the **Tables** page.
- View the status of system processes using the **System** page.

> [!NOTE]

### Marketing contributor role examples

The following examples demonstrate the use of the Marketing contributor role.

#### Multi-geo example

Contoso has two lines of businesses - Real Estate and Retail in two different countries/regions – USA and Canada. They have different sets of marketing users for each country/region who are tasked to tailor specific marketing campaigns that are unique to a country/region. These users are interested in seeing the unified view of customers across the two businesses (Real Estate and Retail) within the same country/region. Even though the probability of customers shopping in both the countries/regions is low, the business wants to ensure that the profiles are unified within a country/region and not across. There are no restrictions or limitations for viewing the data across businesses and countries/regions and they prefer a single Customer Insights - Data environment rather than setting up one environment for each country/region.

#### Multi-brand example

An organization owns two different lines of businesses Automobile and Luxury retail. They own car dealerships including Sales and Services for six car brands and have five luxury retail stores with online presence. A single marketing team operates within the organization across these two different lines of businesses. This marketing team would like to unify profiles within each line of business. The same marketing team is working on the data and there's no specific access control or compliance requirement. They would like to work on a single environment of Customer Insights - Data and don't wish to create one environment for each line of business.
