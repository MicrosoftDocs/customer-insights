# Export segments to Mailchimp (preview)

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-banner](includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

Export segments of unified customer profiles to Mailchimp to create newsletters and email campaigns.

## Prerequisites

- A [Mailchimp account](https://mailchimp.com/) and corresponding administrator credentials.
- [Existing audiences in Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-audience/) and corresponding [audience IDs](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/).
- [Configured segments](segments.md).
- Unified customer profiles in the exported segments contain a field representing an email address.

## Known limitations

- Up to 1 million customer profiles per export to Mailchimp, which can take up to three hours. The number of customer profiles that you can export to Mailchimp depends on your contract with Mailchimp.
- Segments only.
