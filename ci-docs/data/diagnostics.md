# Export diagnostic logs

[!INCLUDE [azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](../journeys/includes/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Forward logs from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data using Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor resource logs let you monitor and send logs to [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/), [Azure Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview), or stream them to [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/). Forwarding your logs to Azure Monitor lets you observe your Customer Instance - Data instance with great flexibility. Some of the use cases you can solve with this data in Azure Monitor Log Analytics include:
- Monitoring and troubleshooting: You can use Log Analytics to monitor and troubleshoot your applications, infrastructure, and network. It helps you identify issues and diagnose problems quickly.
- Security analysis: You can use Log Analytics to detect security threats and investigate security incidents.
- Compliance auditing: You can use Log Analytics to audit your infrastructure and applications for compliance with regulatory standards.

## Logs available for Customer Insights - Data
Customer Insights sends the following event logs:

- **Audit Events**
  - **APIEvent** - enables change tracking via the Customer Insights - Data UI.
- **Operational Events**
  - **WorkflowEvent** - lets you set up [data sources](data-sources.md), [unify](data-unification.md), [enrich](enrichment-manage.md), and [export](export-manage.md) data into other systems. These steps can be done individually (for example, trigger a single export). They can also run orchestrated (for example, data refresh from data sources that trigger the unification process, which will pull in enrichments and export the data into another system). For more information, see the [WorkflowEvent Schema](#workflow-event-schema).
  - **APIEvent** - sends all API calls of the environment. For more information, see the [APIEvent Schema](#api-event-schema).

## Set up the diagnostic settings

### Prerequisites

- An active [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/).
- [Administrator](user-roles.md#admin) permissions in Customer Insights - Data.
- A valid resource on Azure that follows the [destination requirements](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings#destination-requirements) for Azure Storage, Azure Event Hub, or Azure Log Analytics.
- [Contributor and User Access Administrator role](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) on the destination resource on Azure. The resource can be an Azure Data Lake Storage account, an Azure Event Hub, or an Azure Log Analytics workspace. This permission is necessary while configuring diagnostic settings, but it can be changed after successful setup.
- At least the **Reader** role on the resource group the resource belongs to.
- Permission to perform the **Microsoft.Insights/register/action** on the Azure subscription the resource belongs to. For example, the [Monitoring Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/monitor#monitoring-contributor) role includes this action.

### Set up diagnostics with Azure Monitor

1. In Customer Insights - Data, go to **Settings** > **System** and select the **Diagnostics** tab.

1. Select **Add destination**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/diagnostics-pane.png" alt-text="Diagnostics connection.":::

1. Provide a name in the **Name for diagnostics destination** field.

1. Select the **Resource type** (Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics).

1. Select the **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Resource** for the destination resource. See [Configuration on the destination resource](#configuration-on-the-destination-resource) for permission and log information.

1. Review the [data privacy and compliance](connections.md#data-privacy-and-compliance) and select **I agree**.

1. Select **Connect to system** to connect to the destination resource. The logs start to appear in the destination after 15 minutes, if the API is in use and generates events.

> [!NOTE]
> If the Azure subscription that contains the target resource doesn't already have the **Microsoft.Insights** resource provider registered, you might experience a generic network error when trying to set up diagnostics. To check the status, go to **Azure portal** > **Subscription** > **Settings** > **Resource providers** and find the **Microsoft.Insights** provider. If the status is **Registering**, wait until it changes to **Registered**, which can take a couple of hours in rare cases and retry the diagnostics setup.

## Configuration on the destination resource

Based on your choice of resource type, the following changes automatically occur:

### Storage account

Customer Insights service principal gets the **Storage Account Contributor** permission on the selected resource and creates two containers under the selected namespace:

- `insight-logs-audit` containing **audit events**
- `insight-logs-operational` containing **operational events**

### Event Hub

Customer Insights service principal gets the **Azure Event Hubs Data Owner** permission on the resource and creates two Event Hubs under the selected namespace:

- `insight-logs-audit` containing **audit events**
- `insight-logs-operational` containing **operational events**

### Log Analytics

Customer Insights service principal gets the **Log Analytics Contributor** permission on the resource. The logs are available under **Logs** > **Tables** > **Log Management** on the selected Log Analytics workspace. Expand the **Log Management** solution and locate the `CIEventsAudit` and `CIEventsOperational` tables.

- `CIEventsAudit` containing **audit events**
- `CIEventsOperational` containing **operational events**

Under the **Queries** window, expand the **Audit** solution and locate the example queries provided by searching for `CIEvents`.

## Remove a diagnostics destination

1. Go to **Settings** > **System** and select the **Diagnostics** tab.

1. Select the diagnostics destination in the list.

   > [!TIP]
   > Removing the destination stops the log forwarding, but does not delete the resource on the Azure subscription. To delete the resource in Azure, select the link in the **Actions** column to open the Azure portal for the selected resource and delete it there. Then delete the diagnostics destination.

1. In the **Actions** column, select the **Delete** icon.

1. Confirm the deletion to remove the destination and stop the log forwarding.

## Log categories and event schemas

Currently [API events](apis.md) and workflow events are supported and the following categories and schemas apply.
The log schema follows the [Azure Monitor common schema](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-schema#top-level-common-schema).

### Categories

There are two categories:

- **Audit events**: [API events](#api-event-schema) to track the configuration changes on the service. `POST|PUT|DELETE|PATCH` operations go into this category.
- **Operational events**: [API events](#api-event-schema) or [workflow events](#workflow-event-schema) generated while using the service.  For example, `GET` requests or the execution events of a workflow.

## Event schemas

API events and workflow events have a common structure, but with a few differences. For more information, see [API event schema](#api-event-schema) or [workflow event schema](#workflow-event-schema).
