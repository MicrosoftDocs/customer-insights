## What is environment status summary?

This AI-powered feature is designed to summarize business impacting jobs in the system and surface the root failure jobs, if any, so you can quickly investigate the issue. This feature helps eliminate the need to review hundreds of jobs to identify if your environment is processing normally. The environment status summary uses Azure OpenAI and passes information about the job statuses, and other information like job names, to allow the model to create a summary. To learn more about how Azure OpenAI handles your data, see [Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy).

## What are the feature’s capabilities?

The environment status summary detects skipped and failed key jobs based on priority order. A link to the job is provided so you can quickly access the issue.

## What is the feature’s intended use?

The intention is to aid administrators in determining the status of their Customer Insights - Data environment in less time and with less manual effort.

## How was environment status summary evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature was evaluated in English.

The environment status summary is evaluated from dimensions of accuracy and performance. Specifically, this feature was tested with an array of scenarios to ensure it captures and mitigates accordingly, including inappropriate language used, malicious intention of jail break, and data fabrication.

## What are the limitations of environment status summary? How can users minimize the impact of the environment status summary limitations when using the system?

The feature reviews jobs in the following order, if they're configured:

- Merge in data unification

The feature reports only on these jobs and one at a time based on the priority order. For example, if exports are configured, then the feature only identifies if there's an issue with an export.

## What are the supported geographies and languages?

Go to [Copilot International Availability report](https://releaseplans.microsoft.com/availability-reports/?report=copilotfeaturereport).

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

- Users should be mindful when adding data sources, creating segments, measures, and other insights that the names are used in processing the jobs. Users should use responsible, appropriate names.
