# Export segments to AdRoll (preview)

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-banner](includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

Export segments of unified customer profiles to AdRoll and use them for advertising.

## Prerequisites

- An [AdRoll account](https://www.adroll.com/) and corresponding administrator credentials.
- An [AdRoll Advertiser ID](https://help.adroll.com/hc/articles/212011838-Advertiser-Profiles).
- [Configured segments](segments.md).
- Unified customer profiles in the exported segments contain a field representing an email address.

## Known limitations

- Up to 250,000 customer profiles per export to AdRoll, which can take up to 10 minutes to complete. The number of customer profiles that you can export to AdRoll depends on your contract with AdRoll.
- Segments only. A segment must contain at least 100 customer profiles.
