# Export segments to Google Ads (preview)

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-banner](includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

Export segments of unified customer profiles to a Google Ads audience list and use them to advertise on Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Google Display Network.

## Prerequisites

- A [Google Ads account](https://ads.google.com/) and corresponding administrator credentials.
- A [Google Ads customer ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344).
- The requirements of the [Customer Match Policy](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717) are met.
- The requirements of the [remarketing list sizes](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7558048) are met.
- The [configured segments](segments.md).
- The unified customer profiles in the exported segments contain fields representing an email address, phone, mobile advertiser ID, third-party user ID, or address.

## Known limitations

- Export up 1 million customer profiles per export to Google Ads, which can take up to 30 minutes to complete because of limitations on the provider side.
- Segments only.
- Match in Google Ads can take up to 48 hours.

## Set up connection to Google Ads

[!INCLUDE [export-connection-include](includes/export-connection-admn.md)]

1. Go to **Settings** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **Google Ads**.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. By default, it's only administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Enter your Google Ads customer ID.

1. Review the [data privacy and compliance](connections.md#data-privacy-and-compliance) and select **I agree**.

1. Select **Authenticate with Google Ads** and provide your Google Ads credentials.

1. Select **Add yourself as export user** and provide your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data credentials.

1. Select **Save** to complete the connection.

## Configure an export

[!INCLUDE [export-permission-include](includes/export-permission.md)]

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. Select **Add export**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the Google Ads section. Contact an administrator if no connection is available.

1. Enter a name for the export.

1. Choose whether to use an existing audience or create a new one:
   - To update an existing Google Ads audience, enter your [Google Ads audience ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7558048?hl=en#:~:text=Audience%20lists%20is%20a%20section,Display%20Network%20through%20remarketing%20campaigns).
   - To create a new audience, leave the Google Audience ID field blank. Customer Insights - Data automatically creates a new audience in your Google Ads account and uses the name of the exported segment.

1. In the **Data matching** section, select one or more data fields to export, and select the field that represents the corresponding data fields in Customer Insights - Data.

   > [!NOTE]
   > All personal data is sent as a hashed value to Google.

1. Select the segments you want to export.

1. Select **Save**.
