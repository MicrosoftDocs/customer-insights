# Connect to an Azure Data Lake Storage account by using a Microsoft Entra service principal

[!INCLUDE [azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](../journeys/includes/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data provides an option to connect to an Azure Data Lake Storage account by using a Microsoft Entra service principal.

Automated tools that use Azure services must have restricted permissions. Instead of having applications sign in as a fully privileged user, Azure offers service principals. Use service principals to securely [add or edit a Common Data Model folder as a data source](connect-common-data-model.md) or [create or update an environment](create-environment.md).

## Prerequisites

- The Data Lake Storage account has [hierarchical namespace enabled](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace).
- Admin permissions for your Azure tenant, if you have to create a new service principal.

## Create Microsoft Entra service principal for Customer Insights

Before creating a new service principal for Customer Insights, check whether it already exists in your organization. In most cases, it already exists.

### Look for an existing service principal

1. Go to the [Azure admin portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in to your organization.

2. From **Azure services**, select **Microsoft Entra**.

3. Under **Manage**, select **Microsoft Application**.

4. Add a filter for **Application ID start with** `0bfc4568-a4ba-4c58-bd3e-5d3e76bd7fff` or search for the name `Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Insights`.

5. If you find a matching record, it means that the service principal already exists. [Grant permissions](#grant-permissions-to-the-service-principal-to-access-the-storage-account) for the service principal to access the storage account.

6. If no results are returned, [create a new service principal](#create-a-new-service-principal).

### Create a new service principal

1. Install the latest version of Microsoft Entra ID PowerShell for Graph. For more information, go to [Install Microsoft Entra ID PowerShell for Graph](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2).

   1. On your PC, press the Windows key on your keyboard and search for **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.

   1. In the PowerShell window that opens, enter `Install-Module AzureAD`.

2. Create the service principal with the Microsoft Entra ID PowerShell module.

   1. In the PowerShell window, enter `Connect-AzureAD -TenantId "[your Directory ID]" -AzureEnvironmentName Azure`. Replace *[your Directory ID]* with the actual Directory ID of your Azure subscription where you want to create the service principal. The environment name parameter, `AzureEnvironmentName`, is optional.
  
   1. Enter `New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId "0bfc4568-a4ba-4c58-bd3e-5d3e76bd7fff" -DisplayName "Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Insights"`. This command creates the service principal on the selected Azure subscription.

## Grant permissions to the service principal to access the storage account

To grant permissions to the service principal for the storage account you want to use in Customer Insights - Data, one of the following roles must be assigned to the storage account or container:

|Credential|Requirements|
|----------|------------|
|Currently logged in user| When connecting to the Azure Data Lake using the *Azure subscription* option: <ul><li>**Role**: Storage Blob Data Reader, Storage Blob Contributor, or Storage Blob Owner.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the storage account or the container.</li></ul><br>When connecting to the Azure Data Lake using the *Azure resource* option: <ul><li>**Role**: Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read action</li><li>**Level**: Permission granted on the storage account</li></ul><br>AND<br><ul><li>**Role**: Storage Blob Data Reader, Storage Blob Contributor, or Storage Blob Owner.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the storage account or the container.</li></ul><br>Storage Blob Data Reader role is sufficient to read and ingest data to Customer Insights â€“ Data. However, the Storage Blob Data Contributor or Owner role is required to edit the manifest files from within the data connection experience.|
|Customer Insights Service Principal -<br>Using Azure Data Lake Storage as a data source</br>|Option 1<ul><li>**Role**: Storage Blob Data Reader, Storage Blob Data     Contributor, or Storage Blob Data Owner.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the storage account.</li></ul>Option 2 *(without sharing Service Principal access to the storage account)*<ul><li>**Role 1**: Storage Blob Data Reader, Storage Blob Data Contributor, or Storage Blob Data Owner.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the container.</li><li>**Role 2**: Storage Blob Data Delegator.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the storage account.</li></ul>|
|Customer Insights Service Principal - <br>Using Azure Data Lake Storage as an output or destination</br>|Option 1<ul><li>**Role**: Storage Blob Data Contributor or Storage Blob Owner.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the storage account.</li></ul>Option 2 *(without sharing Service Principal access to the storage account)*<ul><li>**Role**: Storage Blob Data Contributor or Storage Blob Owner.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the container.</li><li>**Role 2**: Storage Blob Delegator.</li><li>**Level**: Permissions granted on the storage account.</li></ul>|

1. Go to the [Azure admin portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in to your organization.

1. Open the storage account you want the service principal to have access to.

1. On the left pane, select **Access control (IAM)**, and then select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ADLS-SP-AddRoleAssignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure portal while adding a role assignment.":::

1. On the **Add role assignment** pane, set the following properties:
   - **Role**: Storage Blob Data Reader, Storage Blob Contributor, or Storage Blob Owner based on credentials listed above.
   - **Assign access to**: **User, group, or service principal**
   - **Select** members: **Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Insights** (the [service principal](#create-a-new-service-principal) you looked up earlier in this procedure)

1. Select **Review + assign**.

It can take up to 15 minutes to propagate the changes.

## Enter the Azure resource ID or the Azure subscription details in the storage account attachment to Customer Insights -Data

Attach a Data Lake Storage account in Customer Insights - Data to [store output data](manage-environments.md) or [use it as a data source](connect-dataverse.md). Choose between a [resource-based](#resource-based-storage-account-connection) or a [subscription-based](#subscription-based-storage-account-connection) approach and follow those steps.

### Resource-based storage account connection

1. Go to the [Azure admin portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in to your subscription, and open the storage account.

1. On the left pane, go to **Settings** > **Endpoints**.

1. Copy the storage account resource ID value.

1. In Customer Insights - Data, insert the resource ID in the resource field displayed on the storage account connection screen.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ADLS-SP-ResourceIdConnection.png" alt-text="Enter the storage account resource ID information.":::

1. Continue with the remaining steps to attach the storage account.

### Subscription-based storage account connection

1. Go to the [Azure admin portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in to your subscription, and open the storage account.

1. On the left pane, go to **Settings** > **Properties**.

1. Review the **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and the **Name** of the storage account to make sure you select the right values in Customer Insights - Data.

1. In Customer Insights - Data, choose the values for the corresponding fields when attaching the storage account.

1. Continue with the remaining steps to attach the storage account.
