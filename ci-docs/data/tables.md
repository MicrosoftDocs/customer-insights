# View tables in Customer Insights - Data

After [configuring your data sources](data-sources.md), evaluate the quality of the ingested data on the **Tables** page under the **Source** tab. Multiple capabilities of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data are built around these tables. Reviewing them closely can help you validate the output of those capabilities. [Remove unwanted rows](tables-filters.md) from your source data before processing in Customer Insights â€“ Data.

As you work in Customer Insights - Data enriching your data or creating segments, measures, activities, and predictions, the tables that are created from those actions display on the **Tables** page under the **Output** tab.

For more information about the **Relationships** tab, see [Relationships](relationships.md).

> [!TIP]
> Tables were previously called entities.

## View a list of tables

1. Go to **Data** > **Tables**.
1. To view your ingested source tables, stay on the **Source** tab. To view your output tables, select the **Output** tab.

   The following information displays for each table.

   - **Name**: Name of the data table. If you see a warning symbol next to a table name, it means that the data for that table didn't load successfully.
   - **Source**: Type of data source that ingested the table.
   - **Updated**: Time the table was last updated.
   - **Status**: Details about the last update of the table.
   - **Row filters**: Filter to remove unwanted rows. Row filters are available only for source tables.

## Explore a specific table's data

1. Go to **Data** > **Tables** and select the appropriate tab.
1. Select a table to open the details page.  
1. Explore the different fields and records included for that table.

   - The **Attributes** tab is selected by default and shows details for the selected table, such as field names, data types, and types. The **Type** column shows Common Data Model associated types, which are either autoidentified by the system or [manually mapped](data-unification-map-tables.md) by users. These types are semantic types that can differ from the attributes' data types. For example, the field *Email* in the screenshot has a data type *String* but its (semantic) Common Data Model type might be *Email*, *EmailAddress*, or *Identity.Service.Email*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > This page shows only a sample of your table's data. To view the full data set, go to the **Data sources** page, select a table, select **Edit**, and then view this table's data with the Power Query editor as explained in [Data sources](data-sources.md).

     To learn more about the data ingested in the table, the **Summary** column provides some important data characteristics, such as nulls, missing values, unique values, counts, and distributions, whatever is applicable to your data. Select the chart icon to see the summary of the data.

   - The **Data** tab shows details about individual records of the table. Details listed depend on the table's data type.

   - The **Reports** tab (available for some tables) enables you to visualize your data by creating a report, which includes these columns:

     - **Report name**: Name of the report.
     - **Created by**: Name of the person who created the table.
     - **Created**: Date and time of the table creation.
     - **Edited by**: Name of the person who modified the table.
     - **Edited**: Date and time of the table modification.

## View Customer Insights - Data tables in Dataverse

Some Customer Insights - Data tables are available in Dataverse. The following sections describe the expected schema of these tables. The logical name of the tables is prepended with the string `msdynci`.

- [CustomerProfile](#customerprofile)
- [AlternateKey](#alternatekey)
- [UnifiedActivity](#unifiedactivity)
- [CustomerMeasure](#customermeasure)
- [Enrichment](#enrichment)
- [Prediction](#prediction)
- [Segment membership](#segment-membership)

[Measures created as tables](dataverse-measures.md) are also available in Dataverse.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. Select **Tables** on the left navigation and set the filter to show **All** tables. The default filter is set to **Recommended**, which doesn't include Customer Insights - Data tables. In the search field, enter `msdynci`. Learn more: [View tables in Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-entities-portal#view-tables).
