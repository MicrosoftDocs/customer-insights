Under **Recent segments**, you see groups of customers based on demographic, behavioral, or transactional attributes that you've defined. [Creating segments](segments.md) helps you to group your customer base and better target your business activities.

**Recent measures** show tiles with [key performance indicators (KPIs)](measures.md) that you've defined. For example, average likelihood of a customer to churn or the average online spend per customer.

The **Recent enrichments** section lists the results of the enrichment runs that completed recently. [Enrichments](enrichment-hub.md) add information about your customer base. For example, by understanding the interests and brands that they have affinity for.
