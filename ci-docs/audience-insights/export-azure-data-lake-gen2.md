# Connector for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (preview)

Store your Customer Insights data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or use it to transfer your data to other applications.

## Configure the connector for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

1. In audience insights, go to **Admin** > **Export destinations**.

1. Under **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**, select **Set up**.

1. Give your destination a recognizable name in the **Display name** field.

1. Enter **Account name**, **Account key**, and **Container** for your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
    - To learn how to create a storage account to use with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, see [Create storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/create-data-lake-storage-account). 
    - To learn more about how to find the Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage account name and account key, see [Manage storage account settings in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-manage).

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select the box next to each of the entities you want to export to this destination.

1. Select **Save**.

Exported data is stored in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container you configured. The following folder paths are automatically created in your container:

- For source entities and entities generated by the system: `%ContainerName%/CustomerInsights_%instanceID%/%ExportDestinationName%/%EntityName%/%Year%/%Month%/%Day%/%HHMM%/%EntityName%_%PartitionId%.csv`
  - Example: `Dynamics365CustomerInsights/CustomerInsights_abcd1234-4312-11f4-93dc-24f72f43e7d5/BlobExport/HighValueSegment/2020/08/24/1433/HighValueSegment_1.csv`
- The model.json for the exported entities will reside at the %ExportDestinationName% level
  - Example: `Dynamics365CustomerInsights/CustomerInsights_abcd1234-4312-11f4-93dc-24f72f43e7d5/BlobExport/model.json`

## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#export-data-on-demand). The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab).
